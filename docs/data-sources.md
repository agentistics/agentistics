# Data Sources

agentistics reads data exclusively from local files written by Claude Code. No data ever leaves your machine.

## File paths

| Source | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Stats Cache** | `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` | Pre-computed aggregates: daily activity, tokens per model, streak |
| **Session Meta** | `~/.claude/usage-data/session-meta/*.json` | Detailed per-session metadata — preferred source |
| **Raw JSONL** | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` | Raw conversation logs — used as fallback and for agent metrics |
| **Local Git** | `git log --numstat` | Commits, files, and line counts within each session's time window |

## Data flow

```

    server/data.ts  (buildApiResponse — main orchestrator)
    server/agent-metrics.ts  (extractAgentMetrics — every agent launch the parent records)
    server/subagent-join.ts  (pure — which transcript belongs to which invocation)
         ↓
    /api/data  →  useData()  →  useDerivedStats()  →  React components
```

## Session sources

Sessions can come from three sources, indicated by the `_source` field:

| Source | `_source` | Data quality |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Session-meta JSON | `'meta'` | Most complete — has all fields including cache tokens, tool breakdown, and agent metrics |
| Direct JSONL parse | `'jsonl'` | Good — parsed on the fly from raw conversation files |
| Subdirectory scan | `'subdir'` | Partial — limited fields, no git line counts or cache tokens |

`'meta'` sessions are always preferred. `'jsonl'` and `'subdir'` fill in sessions where metadata is not available.

## JSONL parsing pipeline

When session-meta is absent, `server/jsonl.ts` parses each `.jsonl` file line by line:

```
.jsonl file
  ├── Extracts start_time and duration (first + last message timestamps)
  ├── Counts user messages (excluding tool_result)
  ├── Counts assistant messages (type: 'assistant')
  ├── Maps tool_use → tool_counts { Bash: N, Read: N, Edit: N, ... }
  ├── Attributes output tokens per tool (tool_output_tokens)
  ├── Detects agent instruction file reads (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, etc.)
  ├── Extracts tokens from usage field (input, output, cacheRead, cacheWrite)
  ├── Detects commits: regex /^git commit\b/ in Bash inputs
  ├── Detects pushes: regex /^git push\b/ in Bash inputs
  ├── Detects languages by file extension (Read, Edit, Write tool paths)
  ├── Counts files Claude directly modified (unique paths from Edit/Write/MultiEdit calls)
  ├── Counts tool errors (tool_result.is_error = true)
  ├── Captures first prompt (first 200 chars)
  ├── Records message hours (array 0–23)
  └── Returns SessionMeta object (files_modified = max(git-based, claude-direct-edits))
```

## SessionMeta structure

```typescript
interface SessionMeta {
  session_id: string               // Session UUID

  duration_minutes: number         // Total duration
  user_message_count: number       // Actual user messages
  assistant_message_count: number  // Model responses
  tool_counts: Record<string, number>         // e.g.: { Bash: 12, Read: 8 }
  tool_output_tokens: Record<string, number>  // Output tokens attributed per tool
  agent_file_reads: Record<string, number>    // Agent instruction file reads
  languages: string[]              // Detected coding languages
  git_commits: number              // Commits via AI assistant
  git_pushes: number               // Pushes via AI assistant
  input_tokens: number             // Tokens sent to the model
  output_tokens: number            // Tokens generated
  cache_read_tokens: number        // Tokens served from prompt cache
  cache_write_tokens: number       // Tokens written to prompt cache
  lines_added: number              // Lines added (git)
  lines_removed: number            // Lines removed (git)
  files_modified: number           // Unique files modified
  message_hours: number[]          // Message turn hours (0–23)
  first_prompt: string             // First 200 chars of the first user message
  tool_errors: number              // Total tool errors
  uses_task_agent: boolean         // Used Task/Agent sub-agent tool
  uses_mcp: boolean                // Used MCP tools
  model?: string                   // Model ID (if available)
  _source: 'meta' | 'jsonl' | 'subdir'
}
```

## Stats cache limitations

`~/.claude/stats-cache.json` is written by Claude Code and has **no project-level granularity**. Project breakdowns are computed by agentistics by summing individual sessions grouped by `project_path`.

`dailyModelTokens` in the stats cache stores per-day/per-model totals but not the input/output split per day. When filtering by date, the global model usage proportions (input% / output%) are used as an approximation for the split.

## Agent metrics

Agent metrics are extracted from raw JSONL by `server/agent-metrics.ts`. They are only available for sessions whose JSONL files are accessible (`_source: 'meta'`-only sessions may have incomplete agent data if the underlying JSONL was removed).

### Two transcript shapes, and only one of them holds the numbers

Claude Code made the `Agent` tool **asynchronous on 2026-08-14**, and the shape of the result it
writes into the parent transcript changed with it. Both are read.

**Legacy (until 2026-08-13)** — the numbers were inline, and the reader took them from there:

| Field | Source in JSONL |
|---|---|
| `agentType` | `toolUseResult.agentType` |
| `description` | `tool_use.input.description` |
| `totalTokens` | `toolUseResult.totalTokens` |
| `totalDurationMs` | `toolUseResult.totalDurationMs` |
| `totalToolUseCount` | `toolUseResult.totalToolUseCount` |
| `inputTokens / outputTokens / cacheReadTokens / cacheWriteTokens` | `toolUseResult.usage.*` |
| `toolStats` | `toolUseResult.toolStats` |
| `costUSD` | Calculated via `calcCost()` |
| `status` | `toolUseResult.status` |

**Current (2026-08-14 onward)** — the parent's result carries no numbers at all, only a name:

```json
{ "agentId": "a23c974fb8aab9fbf", "description": "Task 1: backup-plan.ts", "isAsync": true,
  "status": "async_launched", "resolvedModel": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
  "outputFile": "/tmp/.../tasks/a23c974fb8aab9fbf.output", "canReadOutputFile": true }
```

The numbers moved into the subagent's **own transcript**, at
`~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-<agentId>.jsonl`, with an
`agent-<agentId>.meta.json` beside it carrying `agentType`, `description` and the parent's
`toolUseId`. `server/subagent-parse.ts` (pure) sums one such transcript and
`server/subagent-metrics.ts` finds it, follows nested subagents and memoizes the result — keyed on
each subagent file's OWN mtime and size, never the parent's, because those files go on changing while
the conversation sits idle.

Three rules that fall out of the new shape:

- **`outputFile` is not used.** It points into the run's scratch directory under `/tmp`, holds the
  agent's text answer rather than its accounting, and is routinely already gone. The durable file is
  the one under `subagents/`.
- **Each model is priced at its own rate.** A subagent commonly runs `haiku` under an `opus` parent
  (four distinct models were measured across 440 subagent transcripts on one machine), so pricing an
  invocation with the parent's model id bills a cheap agent as an expensive one.
- **A nested subagent counts inside the invocation that spawned it.** Only a top-level `Agent`
  `tool_use` becomes an `AgentInvocation`, so a subtree left out here is left out of the session's
  agent totals entirely. The walk is cycle-safe.

### Which agents exist is the DIRECTORY's answer, not the parent's

`extractAgentMetrics` used to build the invocation list from one shape only — an `Agent` `tool_use`
paired with the `tool_result` that answers it. The `subagents/` directory is the authoritative record
of which agents actually ran; the parent is authoritative for how each was launched. Measured on one
machine on 2026-09-06 — 408 conversations, 541 subagent transcripts — three shapes fell through:

| shape | what the parent holds | what happened |
|---|---|---|
| the user interrupted the call | `toolUseResult` is the STRING `"Error: [Request interrupted by user for tool use]"` — no `agentId` | the row existed and was permanently `unmeasured` |
| a **background agent** | the `Agent` `tool_use`, and **no `tool_result` at all** | no row: the launch sat in the pending map to the end of the file and was dropped |
| a **background forked skill** | a **`Skill`** `tool_use` whose result is `{"status":"forked","background":true,"agentId":"…"}` | no row: nothing keyed on `Agent` could see it |

Four top-level transcripts (1,6 MB) on that machine, including a 24-million-token agent worth
US$ 15,76 and two `/code-review` runs worth US$ 6,24 together. `server/subagent-join.ts` (pure) is the
join: an invocation is paired with a transcript by the exact `agentId` first, then by the meta's own
`toolUseId`, one transcript to at most one invocation. A `toolUseId` naming two transcripts is
ambiguous and pairs neither — a half-read link gets published as a measurement, which is worse than
an absence rendered N/A.

Two rules the join exists to keep:

- **A nested transcript never becomes its own row.** It is already counted inside the invocation
  that spawned it, so a second row would report the same tokens twice. Nested entries are excluded
  from the candidate pool outright rather than relying on no invocation happening to match them.
- **A top-level transcript nobody claims adds no row, and is reported rather than swallowed.** Those
  are conversation forks today (5 transcripts, 11,4 MB on the same machine): they belong to no
  `tool_use` anywhere, and whether they are invocations of the conversation they are filed under is a
  separate question.

The gates that decide whether the reader runs at all follow the same rule: a conversation whose only
agent was a background forked skill has no `Agent` in `toolCounts`, so both `uses_task_agent` and the
`agentMetrics` call now also accept "some tool result named an agent".

### An invocation whose transcript is gone reports N/A, never zero

Claude Code deletes transcripts after `cleanupPeriodDays`. When a subagent's transcript cannot be
read, the invocation is still listed — the parent recorded that it happened — and is marked
`AgentInvocation.unmeasured: true`. Consumers **must read that flag before any figure on the
record**: an unmeasured invocation carries zeros because the type has no other value to carry.
`SessionAgentMetrics.totalTokens` / `totalDurationMs` / `totalCostUSD` exclude them and
`unmeasuredInvocations` counts them, so a surface can say the totals cover fewer invocations than it
is showing. This is the same rule `HARNESS_CAPABILITIES` applies to a metric a harness cannot
produce, applied to one row.

### What is NOT tracked for Skills and Tasks

- **Skills** (`/commit`, `/review-pr`, etc.) do not produce individual `tool_use` events in JSONL — only a `skill_listing` attachment appears. Skill invocations can only be inferred indirectly from subsequent tool calls.
- **Tasks** (`TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate`) have subject/description/status but no token or duration breakdown.

## Live session context

The composer's context ring and the leader hand-off hint use the same live reading. For an exactly
linked conversation, the host resolves its transcript through the chat reader: the default store
and all registered account roots, with the newest copy winning. This also works when a session
inherited an account config directory but its registry row has no `accountId`. A workspace directory
alone never selects a conversation.

Live readings refresh independently of the consolidated history cache. Claude shares the incremental
transcript walk; Codex, Gemini and Kimi reuse their adapters' context arithmetic over a bounded,
widening tail, cached by file version. An unavailable reading leaves the consolidated value intact.
Harnesses without a measured context gauge remain without one.

## Git data

Git stats are computed by running:

```bash
git -C <project_path> log --numstat --after="<session_start>" --before="<session_end>"
```

This produces: commits count, files modified, lines added, lines removed.

Git stats are only available for sessions whose `project_path` is an accessible git repository at query time.

### Workspace folder fallback

`getProjectGitStats` in `server/git.ts` first tries the project path as a single git repo. If that fails (the path is not itself a git repo), it falls back to scanning one level of subdirectories and aggregating stats across all git repos found there. This handles workspace folders (e.g. `~/zuke`) that contain multiple sub-repos.

### files_modified counting

`server/jsonl.ts` tracks a `claudeFilesModified` Set of unique file paths from Edit, Write, and MultiEdit tool calls. The final `files_modified` value is `Math.max(gitFileStats.filesModified, claudeFilesModified.size)`, whichever is higher. This ensures files Claude edited in non-git directories are still counted.

The FILES KPI in `useData.ts` always prefers session-level `files_modified` (which captures direct Claude edits). It only falls back to project-level `git_stats.files_modified` when sessions show 0.


## OpenCode

OpenCode metrics are read from its SQLite `session`, `message`, and text `part` rows. The reader
uses `OPENCODE_DB` when set, otherwise `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/opencode.db` (default
`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`); `OPENCODE_DIR` is Agentistics's directory override.
`OPENCODE_DB_PATH` is ignored, matching OpenCode. Disable with `AGENTISTICS_HARNESS_OPENCODE=0`.

The database is opened read-only with WAL visibility. Session totals and step-finish usage repeat
message counters and are not counted twice. Tokens, per-model API price estimates and the last
prompt context reach the same dashboard/fleet/footer path as other harnesses. Unknown routes have
no price; unknown context windows have no percentage. Tool and file activity remain unavailable.
Credential tables are not read, and this mixed-content database is not archived.
