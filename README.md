## What is agentistics?

agentistics reads what your AI coding assistants already write to disk and turns it into
tokens, costs, sessions and activity you can actually reason about. Nothing is uploaded: on a
single machine it never opens an outbound connection at all, and in Team Mode a machine sends
**computed metrics only** — never chat.

It tracks **six harnesses** side by side:

| Harness | Read from | Tokens & cost | Agent metrics | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/` | ✅ | ✅ | The deepest source — agent invocations, git line counts, workflow runs |
| **Codex CLI** | `~/.codex/sessions/` | ✅ | — | |
| **Gemini CLI** | `~/.gemini/tmp/` | — | — | Local files carry no token data |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `~/.copilot/session-state/` | ✅ | — | MCP tool calls counted |
| **Antigravity (`agy`)** | `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/` | ✅ | — | Decoded from its own protobuf blobs; edit deltas for lines changed |
| **Kimi Code** | `~/.kimi-code/sessions/` | ✅ | — | Routes to other providers; priced by the routed model |

A metric a harness genuinely cannot produce renders as **N/A**, never as a confident `0` —
`HARNESS_CAPABILITIES` in `@agentistics/core` is the single source of truth for which is which.

## Install

<a name="install"></a>

### Linux / WSL — one line

```bash
curl -fsSL https://agentistics.com.br/cli | bash
```

Or via npm — same binary, downloaded by `postinstall` from the same GitHub Release:

```bash
npm i -g @agentistics/agentop
```

Both install the identical Linux x86_64 binary; use whichever fits your workflow (npm is handy
when `agentop` is a dependency of another project's scripts).

Then just run it:

```bash
agentop
```

Bare `agentop` on a terminal opens the **control center** — one full-screen application in the
terminal's alternate buffer, so it adds nothing to your scrollback.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/control-center.gif" alt="The agentop control center" width="100%" />
</p>

Its tabs are **Services** (start / stop / restart this machine, a central, or the Docker machine;
connect to or leave a central; enable a boot service), **Setup**, **Logs**, **Commands**, **Help**
and **Contribute**. Screens change with `←`/`→`, panes with `tab`, and the footer always names the
keys that work *in the current focus*.

Open the dashboard at **http://localhost:47292** (the API + MCP endpoint stays on **47291**).

### Windows

Download the latest `.msi` or `.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/agentistics/agentistics/releases/latest).
On first launch agentistics detects your Claude Code data path automatically (Windows native or WSL).

> **SmartScreen warning?** "More info → Run anyway". The binary is not code-signed yet.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentistics/agentistics.git
cd agentistics && bun install
bun run dev            # API (47291) + UI dev server (47292)
```

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bun run dev` | API + Vite dev server in parallel |
| `bun run watch` | OTel daemon only |
| `bun test` | Unit tests |
| `bun run build:binary` | Full build → `release/agentop` |

---

## The terminal dashboard

`agentop` opens the control center, and its **Dashboard** tab is a live dashboard that needs no
browser — Overview, Projects, History, Costs, Harnesses and Hardware, switched with the digits or
`tab`. (`agentop tui` is an alias for `agentop`.)

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/tui.gif" alt="agentop tui" width="100%" />
</p>

## The dashboard

### Pages

| Page | Route | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `/` | KPIs, activity over time, heatmap, hourly usage, highlights |
| Costs | `/costs` | Spend by model and date, budget and forecast, cache efficiency |
| Repositories | `/repositories` | Grouped by **git remote**, so one repo unifies across people, paths and machines |
| Actions | `/repositories/actions` | Sessions produced by CI runners |
| Tags | `/tags` | Saved, named groupings — "what did Client X cost this month" |
| Tools | `/tools` | Tool-call ranking and token attribution |
| Compare | `/compare` | Every harness side by side |
| Custom | `/custom` | Drag-and-drop layout builder |

### Comparing harnesses

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/machine-compare.gif" alt="The compare page" width="100%" />
</p>

### Repositories

Metrics group by **normalized git remote** (`host/org/repo`), independent of where the repo is
checked out or which machine produced the work. A repo's detail page carries Overview, Members,
Sessions, an **Actions** tab when it has CI runs, and a **Dynamic Workflows** tab that renders each
multi-agent Workflow run as a phase-by-phase timeline.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/machine-repositories.gif" alt="Repositories and repo detail" width="100%" />
</p>

### Tags

A tag is a saved grouping of sources — repositories, projects, machines, teams or accounts —
optionally pinned to a date window. Tag responses are **aggregate-only**: counts and sums, never
session rows or transcripts, with any key the viewer cannot see collapsed into an "other" bucket.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/machine-tags.gif" alt="Tags" width="100%" />
</p>

### Custom layouts

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/machine-custom.gif" alt="The custom layout builder" width="100%" />
</p>

### On a phone

The whole dashboard is responsive and installs as a PWA.

## Team Mode

<a name="team-mode"></a>

One machine runs as a **central** and aggregates usage from many **members**. Members push
**computed metrics only** — raw chat is never stored centrally (it is fetched on demand over a
reverse WebSocket, from the machine that holds it).

Every machine has a role: **solo** (local only, the default), **central** (the aggregator, a Docker
service on port **48080**), or **member**. A machine may be a member of **several centrals at
once**, with different sharing rules for each.

```bash
# host a central
agentop central init && agentop central up

# join one — a token minted by a central with a public URL carries it,
# so the token alone is enough (--endpoint only for a bare token)
agentop member connect --token <token>
```

### Accounts, teams and roles

A central is not a shared password. First boot prints a one-time **setup token** and asks you to
create the **owner** account; everyone else is invited. Accounts carry argon2id passwords, optional
**TOTP two-factor**, and a role. A **team** is a scope key, not a label — being in a team *is*
seeing it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/central-login.gif" alt="Signing in to a central" width="100%" />
</p>

**Step-up authentication** gates escalation, not paperwork: editing an account, deleting a team and
changing a password ask for a second proof. Enrolling a machine, a token or a repository does not —
a prompt people meet daily is a prompt they clear without reading.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/central-dashboard.gif" alt="The central dashboard" width="100%" />
</p>

### What a machine shares — and what it withholds

Each connection carries its own rules across two dimensions (repositories and projects) in one of
two modes: **denylist** (share everything except these) or **allowlist** (share only these). The
rules never travel: the central is told nothing about them beyond a per-dimension *count*.

When several of your machines share one account, they tell **each other** what they withhold over a
**sealed machine-to-machine channel** (X25519 → HKDF → AES-256-GCM, sender and recipient bound into
the authenticated header, keys pinned on first sight and every new pin announced). That is what
makes two things possible:

- A **warning at the point of decision**: before you start sharing a repository, the picker names
  the sibling machines that withhold it. It warns, never blocks — and it always says that an absent
  warning is not proof, because a machine knows only what its siblings announced.
- A **proposal**: a sibling can offer its rules, and applying one may only ever **narrow** what this
  machine shares. Never replace, never widen.

### Presence, self-healing and CI

- **Presence** is WebSocket-authoritative — online while the socket is live, offline within ~8s.
- **Auto-reconciliation**: if the central's database is wiped, a token is rotated or an endpoint
  changes, a member notices and re-pushes its full history. A revoked machine resets itself to solo.
- **GitHub Actions**: an ephemeral runner pushes its metrics with `agentop ci-push`, authenticated
  by **keyless GitHub OIDC** against a registered-repos allowlist. The central stamps the repository
  itself, so a runner cannot mis-report which repo it ran for. See [docs/github-actions.md](docs/github-actions.md).

## Exposing a central on the internet

A central can be published behind a tunnel. `AGENTISTICS_EXPOSURE` selects a profile —
`local` | `lan` | `public` — and **`public` permanently revokes every route that touches the host**
(shell, local chat, raw transcripts, MCP admin) and requires a second factor of every owner. The
profile is the only thing that decides a capability; no opt-in re-enables host power on `public`.

```bash
agentop doctor --exposed     # run this BEFORE opening a tunnel
```

A check that could not be verified reports `fail`, never a reassuring `pass`. On a Docker central
run it from inside the container instead — `./central.sh doctor --exposed` — where `central.env` is
the live environment **and** the database is reachable, so the owner-MFA and machine-token checks
actually run. On the host they cannot, and unverified counts as a failure.

## The CLI — `agentop`

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/control-center-commands.gif" alt="The commands cheat sheet" width="100%" />
</p>

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| *(bare)* / `start` | The control center |
| `setup` | First-run wizard (solo / central / member) |
| `server` | Web + API + MCP + daemon. `--central` runs a central natively (no Docker), `--bg` detaches |
| `restart` | Bounce a mode; `--rebuild` rebuilds first (a **full**, cacheless rebuild — `--cache` opts out) |
| `status` | Services + health |
| `tui` | The live terminal dashboard |
| `watch` | The OTel daemon only |
| `central` | `up` / `init` / `down` / `logs` / `status` / `restart` / `pull` |
| `member` | `connect` / `leave` / `status` / `list` |
| `session` | Start / list / attach / kill background assistant sessions (tmux-backed), or a whole `batch` of them under one task |
| `hooks` | Teach Claude Code to fan work out across several assistants through agentop |
| `ci-push` | One-shot push of a CI runner's metrics |
| `autostart` | Start a mode with the system (systemd user service) |
| `doctor` | Exposure preflight; `--exposed` checks against the strict public bar |
| `setup-token` | Reissue the one-time owner setup token |
| `reset-password` | The way back in for a locked-out last owner |
| `upgrade` · `check-update` | Update, or print a notice when one is due |

`agentop hooks install` installs two things into Claude Code — a **skill** that teaches it to split
independent work across several assistants and start them with `agentop session batch`, and a
**SessionStart hook** that tells each new session which of those are already running. A hook infers
nothing (it is a shell command on an event); the inference is Claude's, reading what the skill
teaches. Nothing is written to `~/.claude` until you run that command, and `uninstall` takes back
exactly what it wrote.

→ **Full reference:** [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) · [docs/claude-integration.md](docs/claude-integration.md)

---

## Costs, and where the prices come from

Costs are computed per session from a pricing table with **three layered sources**, merged in order
of trust: the built-in table (compiled in — the floor), the LiteLLM community dataset, and the
vendors' own pages. A source that fails or returns junk costs freshness, never the ability to price
anything; community rows that imply a unit change or sit more than tenfold from the built-in figure
are dropped.

**Settings → Pricing** lists every model *this machine has actually used*, each with its origin
(`official` / `community` / `builtin`) — so a model nobody can price is visible rather than silently
guessed at.

---

## Keeping history that the harnesses delete

Claude Code deletes session transcripts older than `cleanupPeriodDays` (30 by default) on every
startup. agentistics asks once, on first run, what to do about that:

| Mode | What it keeps |
|---|---|
| `consolidate` *(recommended)* | One small JSON of computed metrics per session — survives the cleanup, no chat duplicated |
| `full` | Additionally mirrors the raw transcripts, chat included. Grows without bound |
| `off` | Nothing — `~/.claude` only |

Revived sessions appear in lists and agent metrics but never inflate aggregate totals.

---

## Nay, and the MCP server

**Nay** is a chat panel that answers questions about your own data by calling the MCP tools.
It runs `claude --print` under the hood, so it spends your Claude subscription quota.

The **MCP server** exposes the same analytics as structured tools (summary, harnesses, projects,
sessions, costs, layout building, PDF export) and registers itself at user scope on first start —
so any Claude Code session can use them, not just Nay.

```bash
claude mcp list   # should show "agentistics"
```

→ [docs/nay.md](docs/nay.md) · [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md)

---

## Also in the box

- **OpenTelemetry export** for Grafana, Datadog or any OTLP collector — [docs/opentelemetry.md](docs/opentelemetry.md)
- **Live sessions** — which assistants are running right now, detected from host processes. When
  detection is impossible (not Linux, no `/proc`, a container that cannot see the host) it says so
  instead of rendering an honest-looking zero
- **PDF export** of any combination of sections, period and theme
- **PT-BR + EN**, light and dark, throughout — CLI, TUI and web

## Reproducing the media

<a name="reproducing-the-media"></a>

The GIFs above are recorded from a demo fleet, never from a real machine — a published recording
cannot be taken back, and a real project name or repository in one is a leak.

```bash
# 1. a pseudonymized fleet, derived from this machine's computed metrics
#    (never from transcripts, so chat cannot reach it by construction)
bun run packages/server/scripts/seed-demo.ts --split 3 --force

# 2. run them
HOME=~/.agentistics-demo-home-1 PORT=47391 ./release/agentop server &

# 3. record
packages/server/scripts/record-all.sh                    # terminal → .cast + .gif
bun run packages/server/scripts/record-web.ts            # web → .gif
```

Terminal recordings are [asciinema](https://asciinema.org) casts (`casts/*.cast`, embeddable as a
real player with selectable text) rendered to GIF with [`agg`](https://github.com/asciinema/agg).
