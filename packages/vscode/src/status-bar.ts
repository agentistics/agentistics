/**
 * status-bar.ts — today's spend, and how many sessions are waiting on a person.
 *
 * Two numbers with two different refresh rates, on purpose. The fleet is polled every 5 seconds
 * (the cockpit's own interval, so the two stay in step) and is a few kilobytes. `/api/data` is the
 * whole metrics payload — megabytes on a well-used machine — so it is re-read on a much slower
 * timer that the user can lengthen. Polling the large one at the small one's rate would spend a
 * megabyte a minute to move a figure that changes once a turn.
 *
 * **An unreachable server prints a sentence, never a zero.** `R$ 0,00` from a machine whose server
 * is not running is a confident, wrong answer to the one question this item exists to answer — the
 * same N/A-versus-a-real-0 rule the dashboard applies to a harness that cannot produce a metric.
