/**
 * protocol.ts — the wire between the extension host and its webview, and the shapes the local
 * `agentop server` answers with.
 *
 * ONE rule governs everything here: the extension holds no rule about what a session may take.
 * Every `enabled` flag, every verb label and every refusal sentence arrives already decided from
 * `/api/fleet`, which resolves them through the same `sessionActions` the terminal cockpit resolves
 * every keypress against. A second implementation in an editor extension would be a third set of
 * rules — after the cockpit's and the browser's — and it would go wrong in the expensive direction:
 * offering "answer its question" on a numbered dialog belonging to a harness with no verified way
 * to pick, where the keystroke takes whichever option happens to be highlighted.
 *
 * The webview performs no HTTP of its own either. It could (a CSP `connect-src` would allow it),
 * but then a Remote-SSH or Codespaces window would be asking a `localhost` that is the BROWSER's,
 * not the machine the sessions run on. The extension host is the process that sits beside the
 * fleet, so it is the process that asks.
