/**
 * api.ts — the extension host's half of the local `agentop server`.
 *
 * The ONE process that talks HTTP. It runs beside the fleet (or, under Remote-SSH, on the machine
 * the fleet is on), which is the whole reason the webview does not fetch for itself: a webview's
 * `localhost` is the BROWSER's, and in a remote window that is not the machine the sessions run on.
 *
 * Every method is TOTAL. A server that is not running, a central that refuses, a profile with no
 * host power and a socket that died mid-request are four different answers and are kept apart —
 * `LinkStatus` is what carries the difference to the screen. Nothing here throws at the caller, and
 * nothing here invents a value: a failed read of the fleet keeps the PREVIOUS one, exactly as the
 * cockpit's poller does, because the last known truth beats a confident empty list.
