/**
 * App.tsx has no test file of its own — a "thousand-line component" per its own comment on the
 * Studio button block. What is tested here is exactly what the slots/references design requires and
 * nothing else: the first-open dot's own pure persistence functions, which still live in App.tsx —
 * pulled out precisely so they can be asserted without clicking through the whole page in a browser
 * (this repo has no jsdom and no `@testing-library/react`, so a click cannot be simulated and
 * `useEffect` never runs under `renderToStaticMarkup` — the same constraint `Studio.test.tsx`
 * documents).
 *
 * A fix-wave review planted six defects that left the whole web suite green with the button's
 * contract entirely unguarded (see that review's I1). Two of the six live here:
 *
 *   - the `try/catch` around `localStorage.getItem` removed            — covered below
 *   - the `try/catch` around `localStorage.setItem` removed            — covered below
 *
 * The THIRD (`aria-pressed={studioOn} → aria-pressed({false})`) used to live here too, against
 * `SessionHeaderSwitcher` — App.tsx's own render of the panel switcher, back when it was the FIXED
 * HEADER's tab group. This pass (design item 1/2, owner's drawing: "the top bar becomes clean and
 * dedicated to the title etc") moves that whole switcher DOWN into the bottom band, merging it with
 * the band's own former occupant segment — so the component is gone from App.tsx entirely and its
 * markup coverage moved with it, to `bandControls.test.tsx`'s own `PanelBar` section, next to the
 * component it now tests.
