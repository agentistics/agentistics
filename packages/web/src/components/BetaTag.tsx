/**
 * BetaTag — the one mark that says a feature is still being tried out.
 *
 * It is a component and not a string because the ALM board reaches SIX surfaces — its own page, the
 * nav on desktop and on mobile, the session's Task tab, the session menu's "file under a task", and
 * the right-click on a session card — and a caveat that appears on four of them is worse than none:
 * the reader concludes the two unmarked ones are the finished part.
 *
 * It is deliberately QUIET. A beta mark is a caveat, not an alarm: it must be readable and must not
 * compete with the status colours the board's whole legibility rests on, so it takes no accent
 * colour of its own. And it is never colour alone — the word is the signal, which is also what a
 * screen reader and a colour-blind reader get.
