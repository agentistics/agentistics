 * SessionsAside — the fleet, in the sidebar's body.

 * with — because two implementations of "which band does this row belong to" is exactly the defect
 * this whole branch exists to remove. What this file owns is the drawing.
 *
 * The list is the FLEET, not the stored history: it shows a session that is running with no stored
 * conversation behind it (an `external` assistant, a `lost` row after a reboot, one started a moment
 * ago), which the old page could not, because it listed metrics and hung the fleet off them as
 * decoration.
