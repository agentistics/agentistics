/**
 * RepoFileEditor — ONE open file: Monaco over its text, and a save that can never silently
 * overwrite a change that landed while the file was open — with ONE STATED LIMIT, below. That last
 * clause is the whole reason the repository explorer is allowed to WRITE at all, so it is stated as
 * an invariant rather than left as behaviour:
 *
 *   **THE BASELINE MOVES ONLY ON A FACT, OR ON A PERSON'S EXPLICIT CHOICE.** Every write is PINNED
 *   to `SaveState.mtimeMs` — the mtime the buffer on screen was READ at. The server compares that
 *   pin against the file immediately before writing and refuses outright (409, nothing written)
 *   when they differ, answering with the CURRENT content and mtime. Exactly three things may move
 *   the pin: a successful write (the server states the new mtime), adopting the disk version
 *   (`take-disk`), and a person choosing to write over it (`keep-mine`). A refusal never moves it —
 *   advancing the pin on a 409 would turn the next save into the blind overwrite this feature
 *   exists to prevent. And the pin moves only TOGETHER WITH the write that earns it: `keep-mine` is
 *   handed to `writeNow` rather than dispatched beside it, because a pin that advanced while the
 *   write was refused by its own guards would leave a dirty buffer pinned to the disk mtime with no
 *   question open — the one silent clobber this file is built to make unreachable.
 *
 *   **THE ONE LIMIT, STATED: the comparison is an mtime, so it is only as fine as the filesystem's
 *   clock.** `editor-fs.ts`'s `planFileWrite` compares `st.mtimeMs`, and on a mount whose mtime
 *   granularity is coarse — **WSL2's `/mnt/c` DrvFs is exactly one, and this product's users run
 *   WSL2** — an agent write that lands in the same tick as our read produces an IDENTICAL mtime, so
 *   the pin still matches and that write IS overwritten, with no 409 and no prompt. Repos on ext4
 *   (`/home/...`, where a session's worktree normally lives) have nanosecond mtimes and are not
 *   affected. Everywhere the mtime moves at all, the guarantee above holds exactly as written. The
 *   airtight version is a content hash carried beside the mtime, which is a change to the server's
 *   own write contract and is deliberately NOT implemented here — a limit this product states is
 *   worth more than a guarantee it quietly cannot keep.
 *
 * ONE INSTANCE IS ONE OPEN FILE, AND THE HOST MUST KEY IT BY PATH. `path`/`sessionId` changing is
 * handled — the reducer is reset before the new read, whatever that read turns out to be, so a
 * failed or BINARY read cannot leave the previous file's edit count latched into
 * `onDirtyChange(true)` — but a `key` on the host's side is still what makes Monaco's own mount,
 * scroll position and undo history belong to the file on screen. `ArtifactsAside` supplies it.
 *
 * THE STATE MACHINE IS PURE AND LIVES HERE (`nextSaveState` / `saveGate` / `saveEventFor`), the
 * same split `RepoSearchView` makes for its debounce: this repo has no jsdom and no
 * `@testing-library/react` (see `ConnectionCard.test.tsx`'s own note), so the only way a transition
 * can be ASSERTED rather than believed is for it to be a function. `RepoFileEditor.test.tsx` drives
 * every one of them, including the two that are easy to get wrong: an AUTOSAVE that meets a
 * conflict, and a SECOND conflict after the person chose to save over the first.
 *
 * THE CONFLICT IS A QUESTION, AND A QUESTION HAS NO DEFAULT ANSWER. Nothing is written, reloaded or
 * merged on its own. The person is offered three things and every one of them is theirs to pick:
 * write over the new version, throw away their own edit and take the new version, or keep editing
 * and decide later. "Decide later" is the `stale` phase, which is NOT the same as dismissing the
 * problem: the pin is known to be old, so autosave STOPS (it would otherwise re-raise this dialog
 * every second and a half) and a banner keeps both resolving actions one press away. An explicit
 * Ctrl+S while stale re-asks the question instead of writing.
 *
 * AUTOSAVE GIVES UP, AND GOES ON SAYING SO. A refusal the SERVER decided — a read-only file, a path
 * that left the session's folder, `not-a-file` — is the same answer however many times it is asked,
 * so after `AUTOSAVE_FAILURE_LIMIT` consecutive ones the automatic path stops: otherwise it is a
 * `PUT` every 1.5 s for as long as the tab is open, and the status line flickers `Saving…` over the
 * very sentence the reader needs to read. A request that got NO answer (`failure: 'unreachable'`) is
 * deliberately not counted — see `failedStreak`. The MANUAL save is left open (a file that becomes
 * writable again must be savable without reopening the tab) and only a write that LANDED — or a
 * fresh read — clears the count: a keystroke is no evidence that a refusal has changed.
 *
 * And because a keystroke is no evidence, it may not ERASE THE SENTENCE either. "Autosave has
 * stopped" is said by `saveStatus` for as long as it is true and something is unsaved, in any phase,
 * precisely because the phase it was first written into is cleared by the next edit — the state this
 * feature must never reach is a switch that reads ON over a file nothing is saving.
 *
 * SEVEN FACTS, SEVEN SENTENCES — the rule this product applies to harness capabilities, applied to a
 * file: still loading, a read that was refused, a BINARY file (never opened as text), a binary file
 * the panel WOULD have shown but that is over its size ceiling, a MEDIA file whose bytes did not
 * arrive, a save that failed, and a conflict. Each has its own wording; none of them is a shared
 * empty box, and the refusals are the SERVER'S OWN sentence wherever it wrote one
 * (`repoErrorText.ts` supplies one only for the failures that arrive carrying none).
 *
 * AND AN EIGHTH STATE THAT IS NOT A SENTENCE: an image, a video or a PDF is RENDERED
 * (`RepoMediaView`), because "binary file, not opened as text here, so it cannot be saved back
 * mangled" is a true reason about SAVING offered to somebody who only wanted to LOOK. Reported as
 * "imagens nao estao sendo suportadas pra abrir". It is read-only and says so, and the guarantee is
 * structural: the `media` load state carries no mtime and dispatches no `loaded`, so there is no
 * buffer, no Save and no dirty dot.
 *
 * `monacoSetup` IS IMPORTED DYNAMICALLY, and that is load-bearing. Its own header says it must only
 * ever be reached that way — it statically imports five `?worker` wrappers, and this component is
 * reached from `ArtifactsAside`, i.e. from the main bundle. A static `import { loadMonaco }` here
 * would put Monaco's linkage in the entry chunk and undo the lazy guarantee Task 4 measured, and no
 * test would notice.

 * why), and a conflict outranks both — and neither of those may ever be drawn as "Saved".
 *
 * `autosave` is here for ONE sentence: once the automatic path has given up, a reader who trusts it
 * has to be told, or a file that quietly stops saving itself looks exactly like one that is still
 * trying. It is said only when autosave is actually ON — the same rule the stale banner follows.
 *
 * THAT SENTENCE IS ABOUT THE TRIGGER, NOT ABOUT A WRITE, so it is said wherever it is TRUE and there
 * is still something unsaved — never only in the `failed` phase. It lived there, and a keystroke
 * erased it: `phaseAfterEdit` clears the failure NOTICE on every edit (rightly — that sentence
 * described text the buffer has moved past) while `failedStreak` survives it, so the common path,
 * somebody who keeps typing into a read-only file, ended with the autosave switch visibly ON, a dim
 * "Unsaved changes", and nothing saving, forever. `take-disk` and `keep-mine` keep the streak too, so
 * a conflict resolved after a failure streak reached the same state by a second route. The tone goes
 * `bad` with it: a dim line is the reassurance this state must not give.
 *
 * It is NOT appended over a write IN FLIGHT (that one may be about to land and clear the streak) nor
 * over a conflict or a stale pin, which name their own, more actionable reason for the pause — and
 * whose banner already says autosave is paused. Two explanations of one pause is how a reader learns

/**
 * RepoMediaView — an image, a video or a PDF, SHOWN, where the Studio used to print a refusal.
 *
 * THREE KINDS, ONE FRAME, and the elements are the ones `AttachmentLightbox` already settled on for
 * the same three: `<img>`, a `<video controls playsInline>`, and a PDF handed to the BROWSER'S OWN
 * viewer in an `<iframe>` with `#view=FitH` and a link out beneath it. That is not a coincidence to
 * be tidied up later — inventing a second answer for "how does this product show a PDF" is how the
 * two surfaces come to disagree about a file the reader opens from both.
 *
 * IT IS READ-ONLY AND IT SAYS SO. The strip where a text file's Save button lives carries the word
 * instead, because an editor pane with no visible save is indistinguishable from one whose save is
 * merely off-screen. The guarantee underneath it is structural rather than painted: this component
 * is reached only from the `media` load state, which carries no mtime, dispatches no `loaded`, and
 * leaves `isDirty` false — so there is no buffer to save and no dot for the host's tab to light.
 *
 * A FAILED LOAD IS A SENTENCE. All three elements report failure as a bare `error` event with no
 * body, so the pane swaps itself for `mediaFailedText` rather than leaving a broken-image glyph or,
 * worse, an empty region that looks like a file with nothing in it.
 *
 * THE SIZE CEILING IS NOT CHECKED HERE. The server decided it on the read and reported it; a file
 * over the ceiling never reaches this component at all (it is the `binary` state with `overLimit`
 * set). A second copy of those numbers in the browser is a second answer to one question.

 * IT CONTAINS FOCUS, because it claims `aria-modal`. On open, focus moves to the dialog's own
 * CONTAINER — never to an answer, which would pre-select one of two losses — Tab wraps among the
 * dialog's controls (`focusTrapTarget`), and the editor behind it is `inert` while it is up. A modal
 * whose Tab walks into Monaco underneath is a promise the markup does not keep.
