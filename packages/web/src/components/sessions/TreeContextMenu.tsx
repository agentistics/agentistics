/**
 * TreeContextMenu — the right-click menu on a tree row, and the `⋯` button that opens the same
 * menu without a pointer (hover/focus on desktop, always visible at 44px on a phone — there is no
 * long-press here, because one collides with scrolling and with selecting the row's own text).
 *
 * A PORTAL, the same posture `SessionRowMenu.tsx` already takes for exactly the same reasons: it
 * must escape the tree's own `overflow: auto` clipping, it is positioned at the pointer (or at the
 * button that opened it) and flipped rather than clamped when it would run off the viewport edge —
 * a menu pinned to the screen's corner would cover the very row it belongs to — and it closes on an
 * outside `mousedown`, on `Escape`, and after any entry is taken.
 *
 * **KEYBOARD (I4, `session-w1c-tree-ops-review.md`).** Opening the menu — by any route: a
 * right-click, Shift+F10 (which Firefox and Chrome both turn into a native `contextmenu` event when
 * a focused element is right-clicked, so this component never has to detect the chord itself), or a
 * click/Enter/Space on the row's own `⋯` button — moves focus onto the FIRST item, which is also
 * what makes Tab reach the menu rather than the next tree row: focus starts inside it, so the very
 * next Tab moves between two menu buttons that are contiguous in the DOM (the portal renders them
 * together), never out to whatever sits after the `⋯` button in the tree. ArrowUp/ArrowDown roves
 * between items (wrapping at both ends — `nextMenuIndex`, exported and pure so this arithmetic is
 * testable without a portal), Home/End jump to the first/last, and Tab/Shift+Tab from the last/first
 * item wrap back around rather than leaving the menu to whatever follows the portal in the document.
 *
 * **RETURNING FOCUS TO THE ROW IS THE CALLER'S JOB, DELIBERATELY NOT THIS COMPONENT'S.** A naive
 * "restore `document.activeElement` as it was on mount" is wrong here in a way it is not for
 * `SessionRowMenu`: picking "Renomear" swaps the whole row for `RenamingRow` in the SAME render pass
 * that closes this menu, so the button this component would try to refocus is already gone, and the
 * rename input's own `autoFocus` must be left alone rather than fought over. Only `RepoTreeView`
 * knows which of "focus the row's button", "let the rename input keep it" or "the row is gone,
 * there is nothing to return to" applies, so it owns `onClose` and does the restoring itself.
 *
 * **THIS COMPONENT DECIDES NOTHING ABOUT WHAT AN ACTION DOES.** It renders a fixed ORDER of
 * entries and reports which one was picked; `RepoTreeView` and, above it, `Studio.tsx` own every
 * rule about create/rename/delete/move. That split is what `treeMenuEntries` exists to test on its
 * own — which entries exist for a file versus a folder, and the one entry that can be absent.
 *
 * **`onMention` IS THE ONE OPTIONAL HANDLER, AND ITS ABSENCE REMOVES THE ROW RATHER THAN GREYING
 * IT.** "Mencionar na conversa" (§6) is wired in by `Studio.tsx`, which always supplies a handler —
 * kept optional here (rather than required) because a disabled row with no explanation would read as
 * a bug report waiting to be filed, while an absent row is simply a menu that does not offer
 * something nobody can use; a future caller that has no conversation to mention into is free to omit
 * it the same way.
