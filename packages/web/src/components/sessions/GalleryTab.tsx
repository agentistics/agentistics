/**
 * GalleryTab — the files a person SENT this session, grouped by the message that carried them.
 *
 * The opposite direction from the panel's other three tabs. Files, Docs and Live all answer "what
 * did this session DO"; this answers "what did I give it" — and the grouping is the whole point:
 * three screenshots of one broken layout went up together, about one thing, under one sentence, and
 * a flat wall of thumbnails throws that away.
 *
 * IT DECIDES NOTHING. `gallery.ts` says which messages carried files, in what order, and what a
 * file's format is; `useAttachmentSizes` asks the server for the sizes and leaves out the ones it
 * could not get. This file draws them.
 *
 * TWO VIEWS OF ONE LIST. The grid shows the picture plus everything the list shows; the list drops
 * the picture and keeps the name, the size and the format. They are not two arrangements of
 * different material — the same groups, in the same order, under the same headings.
 *
 * CLICKING AN IMAGE OPENS IT LARGE, and the lightbox's scope here is the WHOLE gallery rather
 * than one message — in the chat it is the turn that opened it, because there you are reading a
 * conversation, and here the pictures ARE the content, so "the next one" plainly means the next one
 * on the screen. `AttachmentLightbox` is the same component both use; a second one would be a
 * second set of keys for one gesture.
 *
 * RIGHT-CLICKING OFFERS THE MESSAGE — the composer recall modal's own three options, for THAT
 * file's message: go to it, read it here, or cancel. It is offered on every file and not only on
 * the images, because the menu is about the message rather than the picture. On touch there is no
 * second button, so a long press is the same gesture — the one the session rows already teach.
 * "Go to the message" resolves through the shared `goToTurn`, and SAYS so when the bubble is not on
 * the page (the reader is on the terminal view, or the transcript moved on) rather than doing
 * nothing.
 *
 * A FILE THAT CANNOT BE PREVIEWED SAYS SO. It is never a broken image: the format is read from the
 * name before anything is requested, and a request that fails anyway (the file was deleted, the
 * route refused it) falls back to the same card. An absent thumbnail is a fact; a broken one is a
 * bug the reader has to diagnose.
