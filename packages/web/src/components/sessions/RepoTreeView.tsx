/**
 * RepoTreeView — the lazy, gitignore-aware file tree.
 *
 * Expand-on-click, one `GET /api/fleet/tree` call per directory the FIRST time it is opened.
 * `children === null` is the signal — `repoTreeModel.ts`'s own header explains why collapsing never
 * clears the cache, and why that `null` may never be confused with a loaded, empty directory. This
 * component owns NO tree arithmetic: every change goes through the model's `applyChildren` /
 * `applyError` / `setLoading` / `toggleExpanded`, and the rows it draws are `flattenVisible`'s,
 * never a walk of its own.
 *
 * A plain list rather than a virtualized one for now: the row count of an expanded session folder
 * is in the hundreds, not the tens of thousands that would justify windowing — and windowing can be
 * added later without touching the model, since `flattenVisible` already returns exactly what a
 * windowed renderer would slice.
 *
 * THREE EMPTY STATES, THREE SENTENCES, and never one shared empty box. "The listing failed" (which
 * includes the closed gate — `repoErrorText.ts` words both of those), "this folder is genuinely
 * empty" and "the root has not been read yet" are three different facts, and only the second is a
 * statement about the repository. The third draws NOTHING here on purpose: the parent owns the root
 * fetch, so it owns the spinner for it, and two components racing to draw one loader is how a panel
 * ends up with two.
 *
 * A FAILURE IS NEVER SWALLOWED. A directory whose listing was refused keeps its row, with the
 * server's own sentence under it — not a silently missing folder, which is indistinguishable from
 * one the gitignore filtered out.
 *
 * A LIST, NOT AN ARIA `tree`. The role was `tree`/`treeitem` and it claimed two things that are
 * not true here: arrow-key tree navigation (only `Tab` moves between these rows — nothing
 * implements Left/Right/Home/End), and, worse, ownership. ARIA's `tree` owns `treeitem` and `group`
 * children and NOTHING else, so the two error regions — the root-level banner and the sentence under
 * a row whose listing was refused — were plain `div`s sitting directly inside it, which an assistive
 * technology walking the tree may drop: exactly the text the invariant above says is never
 * swallowed. So the rows are a `list` of `listitem`s, each row's failure sentence lives INSIDE its
 * own item (a `listitem` owns arbitrary content, which is the whole reason it is the right
 * container), and the root banner sits OUTSIDE the list, because it is a statement about the whole
 * listing rather than one of its items. Depth rides on the item as `aria-level`, which `listitem`
 * supports and the `button` role does not; `aria-expanded` stays on the button, which does.
 *
 * THE MARK BESIDE A NAME IS `fileIcon.tsx`'s, and this component decides nothing about it. It passes
 * the row's own name and kind and sets only the colour the FALLBACK glyphs inherit — the brand orange
 * for a folder, `--text-tertiary` for a file nothing recognises. A drawn mark carries the language's
 * own hue and ignores that colour, which is why an unmapped file still looks exactly as it did before
 * that module existed.
 *
 * `onTreeChange` takes an UPDATER, never a finished `TreeNode`: the state lives in the parent
 * (`Studio`), which passes its `setTree` straight in, so every model call runs against the
 * LATEST tree rather than one a closure captured before an `await`.
 *
 * **TREE OPERATIONS (create/rename/delete/move) ARE STILL NOT THIS COMPONENT'S DECISION.** Every
 * action a row offers — the context menu, `F2`, a drag — is reported through `TreeOps`, and
 * `Studio.tsx` is what actually calls the server, refreshes a directory and retargets an open tab.
 * What DOES live here, because it is pure interaction chrome with nothing to get wrong about the
 * MODEL, is: which row's context menu is open, which row is the current drag source, and which
 * folder a drag is hovering over — the same class of thing the hover-highlight on `Row` already
 * owned before this task. The one exception is the INLINE RENAME TEXT, which Studio owns (`renaming`
 * on `TreeOps`) because its value survives a refusal round-trip exactly like `Studio`'s own
 * `creating` state for a new file.
