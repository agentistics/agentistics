/**
 * UnsavedChangesGuard — the question the Sessions page asks before it drops the Studio's unsaved
 * buffers, at the level where they are dropped.
 *
 * `SessionsPage` renders this beside the artifacts pane. It does three things, all conditional on
 * `unsavedBuffers.ts` reporting at least one dirty file (so a clean Studio costs nothing and asks
 * nothing):
 *
 *  1. Draws the pending question — raised by the panel's close (`artifactsStore.closeArtifacts`) or
 *     by a navigation held in (2) — in the same `ConfirmModal` the Studio uses for one tab.
 *  2. Wraps the router's navigator (`unsavedLeave.ts`'s `guardNavigator`) so a navigation that
 *     would unmount the pane — another session, the dedicated terminal, any other screen through
 *     `SideNav` or the bottom nav — is HELD until the reader answers. A navigation that keeps this
 *     session's page (a `?view=` switch) passes untouched, and so does a reopen of THIS session,
 *     whose row the server has already retired (`navigationRetiresStudio`).
 *  3. Arms the app's one `popstate` guard (`lib/historyPopGuard.ts`, registered by `main.tsx` before
 *     the router's listener) so the browser's own Back/Forward — the back gesture on a phone — is
 *     held the same way.
 *  4. Registers `beforeunload` for a reload, a closed tab or an external link — the pattern
 *     `pages/settings/Drawer.tsx` already uses.
 *
 * It never keeps a closed panel mounted: the answer "discard" drops the pane exactly as before.
