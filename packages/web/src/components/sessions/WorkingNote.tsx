/**
 * WorkingNote — the quiet line that says the session is busy, under the last message.
 *
 * NOT a message, and styled so it cannot be mistaken for one: no bubble, no mark, no surface, dim
 * and small. It sits AFTER the conversation because that is where the next thing will appear, and
 * it is the only place the reasoning and the tool calls surface at all — rendering them as chat
 * entries drowned the two or three sentences actually addressed to the user under forty commands.
 *
 * It says WHAT is happening in one line, not everything that is happening. The terminal view is one
 * click away for anyone who wants the detail, and this exists so a session that thinks for four
 * minutes does not look stuck.
