/**
 * FleetOverview — the sessions workspace with nothing selected.

 * Every figure comes from the pure `summarizeFleet`, and the one figure that can be absent — how
 * long the running sessions have been up — is rendered as a SENTENCE when it is, never as a zero.
 * Same for the whole screen: a central hosts no sessions, an exposed profile refuses the route, and
 * a failed poll is not an empty fleet. Those are four different facts and this file keeps them four

          The cards count the FLEET — the sessions the aside is listing, narrowed by the same
          `filterFleet` it uses. The heatmap and the per-assistant bars below count STORED METRICS,
          narrowed by every filter including the date range.
          The one dimension that separates them is TIME, and it is named rather than left to be
          discovered: `filterFleet` deliberately ignores the date range, because a live session is
          happening now and "last 7 days" would hide one that started eight days ago and is still
          working. Its header records that reasoning per dimension.
          Both notes exist because a user set a filter, watched the heatmap empty out, and saw the
          cards hold still — a reasonable reading of that is that the cards are stale. They were
          not stale; they were counting a different set, and nothing on the screen said so. Same

/**

 * configure away, and the library's smallest useful chart is bigger than the space.
 *
 * IT SAYS WHAT IT IS MEASURING. A line with no scale is a decoration, so the peak and the span are
 * printed, and the legend carries each harness's own total — which is the number that says whether
 * a line hugging the floor is "a little" or "almost nothing".
 *
 * Every decision about the DATA — the shared axis, zeros for quiet days, a harness with nothing
 * being absent rather than flat — is in `trendLines.ts`. This function only draws.
