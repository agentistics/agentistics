/**
 * SessionTitleFlag — the OPEN session's own delivery control.
 *
 * It used to sit beside the title in the fixed header, then moved DOWN into the bottom bar's own
 * left end (design item 3). The desktop bottom-bar instance is GONE now (owner, 2026-09-21: "pode
 * remover o icone fixo de tarefas tbm... pq agora temos na barra da direita") — `tasks` is a rail-
 * capable panel like any other, so this always-on shortcut became the one control left standing
 * once a reader emptied the bottom band by moving everything to the rail. TWO places still draw it:
 * the mobile panel header and the mobile dedicated-terminal header (both in `SessionsPage.tsx`) —
 * carried over unchanged, since a phone has no bottom band and no rail either (design item 4). One
 * gesture implemented twice is still the bug `task-reopen.ts` exists to have fixed once, so it lives
 * here instead and every caller imports it.
 *
 * The icon is a clipboard (lucide `ClipboardList`), not a flag — the owner's own word for what this
 * is ("a entrega") reads more naturally as a clipboard than a flag once it is not standing beside a
 * title any more, and the drawing names the icon explicitly.
 *
 * Unlinked: an outlined clipboard. Clicking it opens `NewTaskWizard` pre-linked to this session —
 * the same dialog `SessionTasksTab`'s own "New task for this session" composer opens, so there is no
 * second creation flow, only a new entry point into the existing one.
 *
 * Linked: an orange PILL/BADGE (border + tinted background, `var(--anthropic-orange)` /
 * `var(--anthropic-orange-dim)` — the exact pair `SessionFiling.tsx`'s own "selected" rows already
 * use) behind an OUTLINED clipboard. It used to be a bare solid-filled glyph at 13px, which at that
 * size loses the clip-and-lines detail entirely and reads as an undifferentiated colored blob —
 * reported verbatim as "looks like a full battery." A colored container the eye can register as a
 * SHAPE, with the icon inside it kept legible by NOT also being filled, is what `board.ts`'s own
 * `pill()` already does for every status chip on the board; this is the same idea applied to an icon
 * button instead of text. Clicking it opens this session's own aside on the Deliveries tab
 * (`openArtifacts('tasks')`) — the pattern `chatNote.ts`'s `systemRef` navigation already uses for
 * "open this tab of the aside," rather than navigating away from the conversation.
