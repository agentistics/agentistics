/**
 * ArtifactsAside — the session's `contents` panel: what it is doing, and what it produced.
 *
 * THE STUDIO USED TO LIVE HERE TOO, as a MODE that took the whole slot over the moment it opened —
 * one open flag for two components, so opening the Studio lit the Contents button beside it and the
 * Studio's own bar carried a way back into a panel nobody asked to see. It is now its OWN panel
 * (`lib/panelSlots.ts`'s `studio`, rendered by `StudioHost.tsx`), placed independently in the
 * `right` or `bottom` slot — never inside this component, never as a `StripId` this component's
 * strip can select. See
 * `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-studio-slots-and-references-design.md` §1 for the full model.
 * This component is `contents` alone: a header, a tab strip, and one tab's body.
 *
 * THE FILES AND DOCS TABS ARE GONE. They listed what this session itself wrote — one of them a
 * subset of the other — and the Studio's tree holds the whole folder, so the panel held three
 * answers to one question. `ArtifactDoc` survives them: a WROTE row in the live feed still opens the
 * file it names, which is the last reader of it.
 *
 * EVERY SCROLLING REGION HERE IS `overscroll-behavior: contain`. On a phone this panel is a
 * full-screen layer over a workspace whose document is deliberately locked (`lib/mobileViewport.ts`),
 * so a flick that runs off the end of a list must stop where it began rather than chain outward and
 * drag the layer under it. It was reported the other way round — "ele roda a página inteira e não
 * deixa scrollar" — with the whole page rubber-banding out from under the header.
 *
 * IT NEVER CHANGES WHAT IT SHOWS ON ITS OWN. The lists update with each poll of the conversation —
 * that is the "in real time" half — but the OPEN FILE changes only on a click. There is deliberately
 * no effect here that selects an artifact from incoming data: a panel that swaps the document you
 * are reading because the session wrote something else is a panel you cannot read in.
 *
 * THE GALLERY IS THE OTHER DIRECTION. The Live feed answers "what did this session DO"; the gallery
 * answers "what did I SEND it" — the attachments a person put on a message, grouped by the message
 * that carried them. It reads the same `turns` the Live feed does, so it can never claim something
 * the transcript does not show, and its rules live in `gallery.ts`.
 *
 * EMPTY IS NEVER ONE SHARED BOX. "The conversation has not loaded", "there is nothing here" and
 * "this harness cannot be read this way" are different facts and get different sentences. The last
 * reuses `/api/fleet/chat`'s own `unavailable` text verbatim rather than inventing a second wording
 * for the same refusal.
