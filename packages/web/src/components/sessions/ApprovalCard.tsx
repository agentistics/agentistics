/**
 * ApprovalCard — the question a session is blocked on, answerable from the chat.
 *
 * This is the one thing the conversation view cannot get from the transcript: a dialog is on the
 * SCREEN and is never written to the JSONL. It arrives on the fleet row instead — `approvalLines`
 * verbatim, and `dialogOptions` parsed off the frame by `parseDialogOptions`.
 *
 * MOST DIALOGS ARE NOT YES/NO. Claude's permission prompt is `1. Yes / 2. Yes, always / 3. No`, and
 * an `AskUserQuestion` can offer five answers that do different work. A key that "approves" takes
 * whichever row is HIGHLIGHTED, which on such a dialog is choosing for the user — so the options
 * are listed and the PICKED one is sent by number. Where the harness has no verified way to select
 * by number the server sets `canChoose` false and hands over the row's own sentence, and this card
 * refuses in words rather than falling back to the bare confirm key. That fallback is the defect,
 * not the safety net.
 *
 * The card shows the dialog VERBATIM above the options. What the keystroke will do is not obvious
 * from a label alone, and a person agreeing to something should be able to read what they are
 * agreeing to.
