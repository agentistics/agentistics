/**
 * RailSection — one foldable block of the task's right rail.
 *
 * The rail had grown to seven stacked cards, all open, all the time: plan, delivery stats, tokens,
 * status, links, blockers, actions. Every one of them earns its place SOMETIMES and almost none of
 * them earns it at once, so the page became a scroll whose bottom half you learn to skip — and the
 * things people actually reach for (the status, the claim) sat below the fold.
 *
 * So each block folds, and a SHUT one keeps its NAME and its COUNT — the rule the terminal
 * cockpit's menu already follows: a section closed to a bare heading still says what is inside it,
 * while one cut to two rows says no more than its heading did and costs the space anyway. The count
 * goes away once the section is OPEN, where the content states it better and the badge would be the
 * same figure twice on two adjacent lines.
 *
 * The open set is remembered per browser (`boardPrefs`), so a rail arranged once stays arranged —
 * the same reason the board's columns and folds are remembered.
