/**
 * subtaskRollup.ts — pure reads over `TaskDetail.subtaskRollups`, pulled out of `SubtaskTable.tsx`
 * so the empty-vs-N/A-vs-zero decision has something testable to assert against.
 *
 * This project has no React-rendering test infrastructure (see `ConnectionCard.test.tsx`), so the
 * one thing worth getting wrong here — whether a subtask with no session yet renders as an honest
 * "not measured" rather than a `0` — is asserted directly against these functions, not through DOM.
 *
 * **A subtask with no session filed under it renders NO metric field at all — not even "N/A".**
 * It used to render "N/A", which reads as "this was measured and could not be priced" — the wrong
 * sentence for "nobody has done anything here yet". `isUntracked` is the ONE place that draws the
 * line: `sessionsUsed === 0` means metric tracking has not started, and the cell stays blank until
 * a session is actually linked. "N/A" is kept for the genuinely different case — a LINKED session
 * whose cost or token count still cannot be produced (an unlinked conversation, a harness that does
 * not report a figure) — which is a real measurement that came back empty, not an absent one.

 * `task-attach.ts`'s `subtask_in_group`). `groupId` is no longer read here: production carries
 * zero subtasks with it set, and the field survives only as an inert, still-writable column for the
 * already-shipped §B-era write path — see its own docblock in `packages/server/server/sessions/
 * task-model.ts`. Kept as its own function, rather than inlined at each call site, so there is
