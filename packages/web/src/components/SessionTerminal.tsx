/**
 * SessionTerminal — the xterm.js emulator that renders one terminal frame.
 *
 * This module statically imports `@xterm/xterm` (and its CSS), and is itself loaded through
 * `React.lazy` by the card, so the emulator's weight lands in its OWN chunk — downloaded only when
 * a viewer actually opens a terminal, never on the initial dashboard load.
 *
 * Each `frame` from the channel is a COMPLETE snapshot (tmux `capture-pane` already resolved every
 * spinner, redraw and cursor move into final glyphs), so rendering is `reset()` then `write()` — we
 * never append. The cursor is placed from the frame's own `cursor` field and hidden entirely on a
 * dead frame, because the channel sends `cursor: null` once the pane is dead and a cursor blinking
 * on a finished screen is exactly the "looks alive" lie this feature must not tell.
 *
 * FIDELITY vs the box — the fix for the "scattered words" bug. The frame was captured at the pane's
 * OWN width (`f.cols`, routinely 157/200+) and every line is already hard-broken at that width by
 * tmux. Rendering it into an emulator of ANY other column count reflows those lines and scatters the
 * text — so the emulator's COLUMN count is always EXACTLY `f.cols` and never fitted to the box. A
 * 157-column grid does not fit a card, so instead of reflowing (wrong) or clipping to a scroll
 * window (what read as broken), the whole grid is SCALED to the box with a CSS transform: the layout
 * stays byte-for-byte what `capture-pane` drew, only smaller. `transform` is visual only — it never
 * changes the buffer's column count — so nothing wraps. The discriminant between a faithful and a
 * broken terminal is therefore the pane's COLUMN count against the box, and the scale is what
 * answers it; a session broke precisely when its columns overflowed a box the fit did not shrink.
 *
 * SCROLL — the emulator's ROW count is the whole capture (`max(f.rows, f.lines)`), not one screen,
 * so every shipped line lives on the grid and the fixed-height box scrolls through all of it (see
 * `paint`). Sizing it to the visible screen alone left the earlier lines in xterm's own scrollback,
 * which a per-frame `reset()` wiped — so scrolling up never reached the start of the conversation.
 * WHERE that grid is scrolled to is `terminalScroll.ts`: the first row of the LIVE SCREEN, not the
 * bottom of the grid. Pinning to the bottom opened a fresh shell below its own prompt and made
 * `clear` look inert, because tmux keeps the history a `clear` never removes.
 *
 * Timing: `resize()` throws asynchronously inside xterm if it runs before the renderer has measured
 * its cell dimensions (an unmeasured `Viewport.syncScrollArea` reads `dimensions` off `undefined`),
 * and a `try/catch` cannot catch that — the throw is scheduled, not synchronous. The renderer
 * measures on its FIRST render, so we gate the first paint on xterm's own `onRender` event (with a
 * timeout as a belt-and-braces fallback). Frames that arrive before then are held and painted on
 * ready.

       * THE SHORTCUTS THE TERMINAL OWNS, and only while it owns the keyboard.
       *
       * `ctrl+w` closed the tab and `ctrl+l` went to the address bar, so neither ever reached the
       * pane — reported as "quero que os atalhos funcionem ... sem afetar o navegador", which is
       * two requirements, not one. `terminalShortcuts.ts` holds the whole rule: only the letters
       * the channel can actually deliver, never `ctrl+shift+*`, never Cmd/Win, never Alt.
       *
       * It is gated on `interactive`, so a read-only terminal — and any terminal that merely EXISTS
       * on a page somebody is scrolling — swallows nothing. A page-level handler eating `ctrl+w`
       * whenever a terminal was on screen would be a browser the person cannot close.
       *
       * Returning `true` lets xterm handle the key as usual; the `preventDefault` beside it is what
       * stops the browser doing its own thing with the same press. `copy` returns `false` instead —
       * a copy-with-selection must stop xterm's OWN key handling too (which would otherwise still
       * turn Ctrl+C into `\x03` regardless of `preventDefault`), so the browser's native copy is the
       * only thing that runs.

       * (`input-protocol.ts`) re-applies the exact same function and is the actual authority — but
       * because a clipboard payload carrying a planted bracketed-paste end marker
       * (`\x1b[201~touch …\r`) is a real command-injection payload, and refusing it before it ever
       * leaves the browser is strictly better than refusing it a round trip later. Same shared
       * `@agentistics/core` function on both sides, so the two can never disagree about what
       * "sanitized" means.
