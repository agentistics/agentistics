/**
 * useFleetNewOptions — the new-session wizard's own data source: what `/api/fleet/new` answers,
 * searched as the person types.
 *
 * Pulled out of `NewSessionModal` so a second dialog that only needs "which assistant, which
 * folder" (the staged-session compose panel, t-918cc82233) does not restate the fetch, the
 * debounce or the per-kind budget reading — see `formBits.tsx`'s own note on what happens when a
 * second dialog restates a piece instead of importing it.
 *
 * Harness AUTO-SELECTION is deliberately NOT done here: `NewSessionModal` wants to pre-pick a
 * preset's harness or the sole one available, while the staged-session compose panel wants neither
 * (a staged draft is allowed to sit with no harness chosen at all, asked at fire time). That
 * decision stays with each caller, over the `harnesses` this hook returns.
