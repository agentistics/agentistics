/**
 * useTerminalStream — the EventSource wiring for the live terminal read channel.
 *
 * The pure decisions (what each event means, what the user is told) live in `lib/terminalStream.ts`.
 * This hook is the thin, impure glue: open the SSE stream for one pane, funnel its named
 * `open`/`frame`/`end` events through the reducer, and tear the connection down when the id changes
 * or the component unmounts.
 *
 * It is generic over the SCOPE — a fleet row's screen or a per-session utility SHELL — because both
 * channels send the very same frames and differ only in which store the server resolves the id
 * against. The route is never interpolated here: `lib/terminalEndpoint.ts` owns that mapping, so a
 * shell id cannot be handed to a route that would resolve it against the session registry.
 *
 * Two things it is careful about:
 *  - **No leak between sessions.** When `id` changes it dispatches `connecting` FIRST (which drops
 *    the previous frame) before opening the new stream, so one session's screen can never be shown
 *    under another session's name for even a single render.
 *  - **`end` closes the socket.** EventSource reconnects on its own after any drop; that is right for
 *    a transient network blip, but an `end` event is the channel saying the session is GONE, so we
 *    close the socket to stop it silently reopening a stream the server has finished.
 *  - **A connection that never delivers is called out, not spun forever.** If no frame arrives within
 *    `STALL_MS` — the stream opened but nothing came, or the socket is queued behind the browser's
 *    per-origin connection limit and never actually connects — we dispatch `stall`, and the status
 *    line switches from "Connecting…" to an honest "No response" with a reconnect verb. An
 *    EventSource `error` while still frame-less does the same. Neither ever blanks a screen that
 *    already has a frame: there the reducer ignores the stall and EventSource's own reconnect takes
 *    over, so a live terminal that drops a packet keeps its last screen (unchanged behaviour).
