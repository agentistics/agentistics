 * carries `daily[<that day>]` (its counters, zero or not, are still the truth for that day), or,
 * for a session with no `daily` at all, when that session's START day is it — the same

 * field or its harness's adapter does not produce it.
 *
 * `days` restricts which days can ever be covered — pass the CURRENT filter's day set, or a
 * session's whole lifetime leaks into a window that never asked for it. Absent from the map means
 * "nothing in scope can answer for this day", never a zero: the caller falls back to
 * `apportionModelUsage` for those.

 * its WHOLE lifetime total on its start day (the branch below), same as everywhere else this file
 * applies that fallback — `reconciliation.md`'s Defect D, an explicitly ruled-in limit, not
 * Defect A. If `dailyModelTokens` also carries a (correctly split) entry for the NEXT day, that
 * next day is priced by `apportionModelUsage` on top of a start day that already contains its
 * share — over-counting the overlap. `reconcileClaudeDayCoverage` cannot catch this: it only ever
 * demotes a day whose exact total is SIGNIFICANTLY LESS than the cache's, and a day carrying an
 * adjacent day's tokens too is never less. See `useData.test.ts`'s

 * "Covered" (`claudeExactUsageByDay`) means "at least one in-scope session touches this day" — and

 * Code's 30-day retention can delete a transcript before this product ever computed the session
 * into `~/.agentistics/sessions/**`, `archiveMode` is not always `consolidate`/`full`, and even
 * then "the member's deep history exists ONLY aggregated... the individual session docs cover a
 * fraction of it" (see CLAUDE.md's team-mode section). A thin session sitting alone on a day
 * `dailyModelTokens` recorded as enormous is not evidence the day was quiet — it is evidence the
 * local store is missing the rest of it, and pricing THAT as if it were the whole day is worse
 * than the apportioned guess it replaced: it looks exact and it is not.
 *
 * So a day with an entry in `dailyModelTokens` is trusted only when the sessions' own total for
 * that day is not SIGNIFICANTLY LESS than that entry's total — the same total
 * `apportionModelUsage` would otherwise have split. `CLAUDE_DAY_COVERAGE_RATIO` is deliberately
 * loose enough to tolerate the ordinary drift between two INDEPENDENTLY computed totals — Claude
 * Code's own cache versus this product's session parser measured ~0.002% apart on the 246b2b32
 * fixture (the session total came out slightly ABOVE the cache's there, which passes trivially at
 * any ratio ≤ 1) — while still catching what the reviewed case represents: a store missing SIX
 * ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE of a day's real activity is not rounding noise. A ratio close to 1.0 would
 * demote genuinely complete days over that ordinary drift and lose the fix `claudeExactUsageByDay`
 * exists for; nothing in this repo suggests that drift ever reaches double digits, so 0.9 leaves
 * ample room on the complete side without leaving the gap the reviewer measured open on the other.
 *
 * A day with NO entry in `dailyModelTokens` has nothing to cross-check against — the OLD
 * apportionment loop could not have produced anything for it either (it only ever iterates that
 * same array), so trusting the session there is no worse than the pre-Defect-A behaviour and is
 * left alone.
 *
 * Does NOT catch the over-counting case named in `claudeExactUsageByDay`'s header (a no-`daily`
 * session straddling midnight): that day's exact total is never LESS than the cache's, since it
 * contains an adjacent day's tokens IN ADDITION to its own — this check only ever demotes a day
 * for having too little, never for having too much.
