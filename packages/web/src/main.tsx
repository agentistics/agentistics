/**
 * IN DEV, EVICT ANY SERVICE WORKER THAT IS STILL CONTROLLING THIS PAGE.
 *
 * `vite.config.ts` stopped REGISTERING one in dev, and that was not enough: a worker installed
 * before that change keeps serving its cached bundle until something unregisters it. The symptom is
 * the worst kind — code that is provably correct on disk, tested green, and visibly absent in the
 * browser. It cost three rounds of "this did not change" on work that had shipped, so the app
 * cleans up after itself rather than asking somebody to remember DevTools.
 *
 * Dev only, and it also drops the caches the worker left behind: unregistering alone leaves the
 * Cache Storage entries it was serving from. Production is untouched — there the worker is the
 * feature.

/**
 * A CHUNK FROM A BUILD THAT NO LONGER EXISTS RELOADS ONCE, INSTEAD OF SHOWING A STACK TRACE.
 *
 * Reported as an error screen appearing "em diversas telas diferentes", with
 * `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'W' before initialization` inside a lazily-loaded chunk. Nothing
 * in the source explains it — the import graph has no cycle that reaches it, and the same screen is
 * clean under Chromium AND under WebKit. What does explain it is the situation this app is in all
 * day: the server is rebuilt while a phone has the page open. The document holds `index-<old>.js`,
 * asks for a route's chunk minutes later, and the shared chunk that chunk expects has been replaced
 * by a build with different hashes. The pieces load and disagree.
 *
 * `vite:preloadError` fires exactly there, and a reload fixes it because `index.html` is served
 * `no-store` — the next load is a coherent set. Once, guarded by a flag, because a reload loop is
 * strictly worse than the error it replaces: the flag is cleared on any successful navigation, so a
 * genuinely broken deploy still lands on the error screen with its details rather than spinning.
