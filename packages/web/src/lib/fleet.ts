 * A stored session id → the live fleet row driving it.

 * Keyed on BOTH `conversationId` and `id`: the first is the exact link a managed row records (the
 * uuid handed to `claude --session-id`), the second is what a `closed` row — one read straight out
 * of the conversation store — is already named by. A managed row's own id is a tmux session name
 * and can never collide with a conversation id, so one map answers both without ambiguity.
 *
 * **It is a LOOKUP, and its `values()` are not the fleet.** A row that knows its conversation is in
 * here TWICE, by design — so iterating this map counts those sessions twice. That shipped: the
 * broadcast picker was built from `rowsById.values()` and offered `Active 22` on a machine running
 * 11, over an `All` of 357 against a fleet of 329. Use `fleet.sessions`, or `buildPickRows`, which
 * dedupes by id for exactly this reason.
