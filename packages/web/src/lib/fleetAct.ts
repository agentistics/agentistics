/**
 * fleetAct.ts — PURE: what a verb's answer means to the browser.
 *
 * `POST /api/fleet/act` answers `{ ok, message }` and, for a verb that CREATED something, the new
 * session's `id`. That id is not decoration: a reopen mints a new row and retires the one it was
 * asked about, so a caller that does not follow it leaves the reader on a dead session with a
 * success message over it.
 *
 * That is what happened. `FleetState['act']` DECLARED `id?: string` in its return and the
 * implementation built `{ ok, message }` — the id was dropped on the floor. TypeScript cannot catch
 * it: the property is optional, and an object that simply lacks an optional property is assignable.
 * The reopen worked every time, spawned the session, and the UI stood still — reported as "nao ta
 * sendo possivel reabrir pela ui sessoes que estao off". Measured: the server answered
 * `{"ok":true,"message":"started ACESSIBILIDADE VINI in the background.","id":"aeb12129c4"}` and the
 * URL never moved.
 *
 * So the parse is a FUNCTION with a test rather than an object literal inside a callback. The rule
 * it exists to hold: **every field the answer carries is carried on**, and a field is dropped only
 * where dropping it is written down.
