/**
 * mentionSpec.ts — PURE. How to write a file reference into a message, per harness.
 *
 * Three gestures feed one function: dragging a tree row onto the composer, the tree's "Mencionar
 * na conversa", and "Mencionar seleção" in the editor. All three end up here, because the FORMAT a
 * harness reads reliably is a fact about that harness's own CLI, not about which gesture produced
 * the path — the same reason `rename-spec.ts` and `attention-rules.ts` are one table apiece rather
 * than one per caller.
 *
 * `Record<HarnessId, MentionSpec | null>`, not a `Partial`: a harness added to `HarnessId` must
 * fail the build until someone decides, exactly as `RENAME_SPECS` and `HARNESS_CAPABILITIES` do.
 * `null` is the decision, and it means the PLAIN form — a backtick-quoted path a person would type
 * by hand — never an `@` a harness might read as something else. Guessing an `@` for an unverified
 * harness is exactly the mistake this file exists to rule out: `claude`'s own `@` opens a file
 * autocomplete in the TUI, so an unverified harness's own `@`-adjacent syntax (if it has one) could
 * just as easily swallow the Enter or substitute a highlighted suggestion for what was typed.
 *
 * ## claude — verified against a live probe, not assumed
 *
 * Probed 2026-09-12 against `claude 2.1.270`, on a THROWAWAY session (`agentop session claude --bg
 * --cwd <tmp dir with a 6-line sample.ts>`), sending text through the real composer path
 * (`POST /api/fleet/act` → `fleet-web.ts`'s `prompt` case → `promptSession` → `sendTextTo`, the
 * exact route the web composer's Send button uses) and reading the pane back with
 * `tmux -L agentop capture-pane`:
 *
 *   sent: `@sample.ts what is on line 4? Reply with just that line, verbatim.`
 *   pane: `❯ @sample.ts what is on line 4? Reply with just that line, verbatim.` (submitted whole,
 *         nothing swallowed, nothing substituted) → `⎿  Read sample.ts (6 lines)` →
 *         `● export function four() { return 4 }` — exact line 4, verbatim.
 *
 *   sent: `@sample.ts#L3-5 quote exactly the lines you were pointed at, each on its own line,
 *         nothing else.`
 *   pane: submitted whole → `⎿  Read sample.ts (6 lines)` →
 *         `● export function three() { return 3 }` / `export function four() { return 4 }` /
 *         `export function five() { return 5 }` — exactly lines 3–5, nothing outside the range.
 *
 * So `@<path>` and `@<path>#L<a>-<b>` both submit cleanly and both resolve to the right file and
 * the right range — the `#L` form needs no fallback to `@<path> (linhas a–b)`.
 *
 * Every other harness is `null` until someone runs the same probe against it.
