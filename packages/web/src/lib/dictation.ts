 * dictation.ts — PURE: can this browser take dictation, and what does the button say when it cannot?
 *
 * The Web Speech API is the only way to do this without shipping a model or sending audio to a
 * server, and it is NOT universally available: Firefox does not implement it, and every browser
 * that does requires a secure context — so `http://` over a LAN, which is exactly how a member
 * machine's dashboard is usually reached, has no microphone at all.
 *
 * That makes this a capability question, and the rule is the one `HARNESS_CAPABILITIES` states: an
 * absent feature is said in WORDS, never rendered as a control that silently does nothing. A mic
 * button that fails on click is indistinguishable from a broken one.
 *
 * Note what this deliberately does NOT do: no audio is uploaded anywhere by this product. The
 * recognition runs in the browser, and what reaches the session is the TEXT the user then chooses
 * to send — the same text they could have typed.

 * moment of silence all looked identical from outside: the button lit up and went out. A control
 * that fails silently is indistinguishable from a broken one, which is the rule this whole module
 * was written against.
 *
 * `network` matters most: it is the common failure and it is NOT a refusal — the browser's speech
 * recognition reaches a remote service, and a machine that cannot get there has a working
 * microphone and no transcription. Telling someone to check their permissions there sends them to
 * fix the wrong thing.
 *
 * An unknown code is REPORTED, carrying the code itself. A new one must be visible, not swallowed.
 *
 * `aborted` is the one code that is NOT a failure and returns `null`: the recogniser reports it when
 * THIS page ended it — the person clicked the microphone off, or sending ended the dictation. Showing
 * "dictation was interrupted" there told people about their own click, and it stayed under the
