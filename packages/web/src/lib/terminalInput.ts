/**
 * terminalInput.ts — the pure core of the INTERACTIVE live terminal (Phase 2, web half).
 *
 * The read channel (`terminalStream.ts`) shows what a managed session is drawing. This module is the
 * WRITE intent: it turns a person composing a line at the terminal into an honest, auditable send
 * through the one write verb the server already exposes — `POST /api/fleet/act { action:'prompt' }`,
 * which types a line into the session AND submits it, atomically, refusing when the session is on a
 * dialog and answering ok/fail. This module invents no endpoint; it is the browser-side state machine
 * that keeps that write honest.
 *
 * FOUR DECISIONS, resolved explicitly (the assignment's own list) — see docs/terminal-interactive.md:
 *
 * 1. CONSENT — per session, in-memory, explicit, revocable. Typing into a live coding agent changes
 *    another running process, so it is a deliberate opt-in (`arm`), never a side effect of the
 *    terminal being on screen. It is PER SESSION (arming one never arms its neighbour) and held only
 *    for this surface's lifetime — a reload or a re-open re-asks, because "drive this session now" is
 *    a decision to re-make, not a durable grant a stale tab keeps. `disarm` revokes it and drops any
 *    pending line. This is an INTENT gate, not a security boundary — the server's `localShell`
 *    capability + scope + dialog refusal remain the real authority; the gate keeps a human decision
 *    at the head of every interactive session.
 *
 * 2. BATCHED TO A LINE, not key-by-key. The only web-reachable write is `sendText`, which types a
 *    line and presses Enter as one act; there is no endpoint for a single raw key (`sendKey` is not
 *    web-exposed and `sendText` cannot omit the Enter). So per-key is not merely expensive here, it is
 *    unrepresentable. It would also be wrong even if it existed: one HTTP round-trip per keystroke
 *    floods the audit and risks reordering (requests can complete out of order). The line is edited
 *    LOCALLY (the native input is the line editor — backspace, cursor, paste are the browser's) and
 *    ONE request carries the finished line, ordered by construction. Raw char-mode (Ctrl-C, arrows,
 *    no-submit typing) needs a new server keystroke channel and is the documented Phase-2b escalation.
 *
 * 3. FAILURE MID-TYPING — the load-bearing rule: the terminal must never accept a key visually and
 *    fail to deliver it. This design removes the failure surface rather than papering over it: keys
 *    are LOCAL until submit, so nothing is delivered per key and nothing per key can be lost. The one
 *    delivery is the line, and it moves through explicit states — composing → sending → delivered |
 *    failed. A FAILED send does NOT clear the draft: the exact line stays, marked failed with the
 *    server's own reason, ready to retry. While `sending` the composer is LOCKED, so two lines can
 *    never race out of order. The local draft is drawn distinctly from the session's own output, so
 *    local echo is never mistaken for the session having received it.
 *
 * 4. AUDIT WITHOUT NOISE — only the atomic send is auditable (through the existing `promptAudit`
 *    record: who / session / text / when / outcome). Local edits (typing, backspacing) are NOT
 *    audited: they are not sends, and per-keystroke auditing is exactly the flood the assignment
 *    warns against. One line delivered-or-failed is one audit entry — the granularity the write
 *    channel already records; this module adds nothing to that schema.
 *
 * 5. WHERE THE KEYS GO once you are armed — added after the feature shipped and was reported as not
 *    working at all: "a digitação fica especificamente NO input do type into this session ao invés
 *    de me permitir digitar direto no terminal renderizado". Nothing was broken; there were simply
 *    TWO fields on screen taking keys, the arming button focused the WRONG one, and the one it
 *    focused was the one that cannot do what the button's own label promises. So the surface is now
 *    part of the state machine rather than an accident of focus: arming hands the keyboard to the
 *    TERMINAL, because that is what "type into this session" means and what a terminal IS. The
 *    cooked line editor stays reachable — a whole line composed and submitted as one act is
 *    genuinely different from typing, and it is the ONLY way in when the keystroke channel cannot
 *    open — but it is opened DELIBERATELY, and only then does it take focus. Exactly one surface
 *    owns the keyboard at a time; two that both look ready is the confusion this replaces.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and reducer-shaped so the honesty rules above are pinned by tests
 * (`terminalInput.test.ts`), not left to the JSX.
