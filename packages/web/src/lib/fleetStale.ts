/**
 * fleetStale.ts — PURE: is the fleet on screen still the truth, and how do we say it is not?
 *
 * `pollOnce` keeps the last known answer when a poll fails, and the instinct is right: reporting an
 * empty fleet because one request 502'd would say "nothing is running" about a machine with nine
 * live sessions. But the cockpit's own poller keeps the previous list **plus a reason**
 * (`sessions-host.ts`), and the web kept only the list — so with the server down the page went on
 * showing a fleet from minutes ago, rows and all, with nothing on screen saying so. Observed
 * directly: the API answered 502 for a dozen consecutive polls while the list sat there looking
 * live, and the only clue was a header count that no longer matched the rows beneath it.
 *
 * A stale list is worse than an empty one, because an empty one is obviously wrong. This module is
 * the sentence that closes that gap.
 *
 * ONE failure is not staleness. A single missed poll during a rebuild, a laptop waking up, or a
 * server restart is the normal noise of a 5s poll, and a warning that fires on it is a warning
 * people stop reading — the same argument `linkState` makes for not colouring `stale` red on the
 * cockpit's central pill.
