/**
 * keyboardProbe.ts — PURE: what one reading of the mobile viewport says, and how it is written down.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Seven attempts have been made at the iOS keyboard leaving the composer out of place, six of them
 * reverted, and every one of them was reasoned from the code rather than from a measurement — there
 * is no iOS device on the machine this is developed on, and the one browser that reproduces it is
 * the user's own phone. That is the whole reason the count got to seven: a fix is proposed, shipped,
 * looked at, and the only thing that comes back is "it still does not come back", which does not say
 * WHICH of the three quantities that can hold a displacement is holding it.
 *
 * There are exactly three, and the code that restores the position has only ever known about two:
 *
 * - `window.scrollY` — the DOCUMENT scroll. `scrollTo` undoes it.
 * - an inner scroller's `scrollTop` — undone by putting it back.
 * - `visualViewport.offsetTop` — the VISUAL viewport panned inside the layout viewport. Nothing in
 *   a page can write it. iOS holds it while a field is focused so the caret stays visible, and no
 *   amount of scroll restoring touches it.
 *
 * So this samples all three at once, plus the two boxes whose position is what actually gets
 * reported (`#root`, which is the containing block every `position: fixed` descendant answers to on
 * this layout, and the composer itself). One reading at rest and one after a dismissal names the
 * culprit in a single screenshot.
 *
 * It is OFF unless the page is opened with `?kbdebug=1`, so it costs a shipped build nothing.
