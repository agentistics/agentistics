/**
 * replyQuote.ts — PURE: what replying to a message means here.
 *
 * There is no reply THREAD to send. The transport types a line into a tmux pane and these CLIs have
 * one linear conversation, so a reply is a QUOTE: the lines are `> `-prefixed and sent above what
 * you write, which is what the assistant actually reads and is what mail has always done. Saying
 * that plainly beats a UI implying threading the session cannot do.
 *
 * Three decisions, each of which can be wrong, and none of which belongs in JSX:
 *
 * 1. WHAT TRAVELS. The quote is spent CONTEXT — a reply echoing forty lines back at the session
 *    costs it window for nothing it does not already have. Four lines name the message; an ellipsis
 *    says there was more.
 * 2. WHAT THE BAR SHOWS. The first line or two, with the blank lines dropped: a message that opens
 *    with a fenced block or a heading would otherwise preview as two empty rows, which reads as a
 *    reply to nothing.
 * 3. WHO IS BEING REPLIED TO. "Replying to" with no name is the one thing the bar exists to answer.
 *    The user's own turn is "You"; an assistant turn is the HARNESS, by the name the rest of the
 *    product calls it.
