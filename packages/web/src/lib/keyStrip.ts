/**
 * keyStrip.ts — PURE. The mobile key strip, and what `ctrl` does on a phone.
 *
 * It was `shellKeys.ts` and belonged to the utility shell alone, which is why the ASSISTANT's own
 * terminal had no `esc`, no arrows and no Ctrl+C on a phone at all — the larger gap of the two,
 * since a permission dialog's own footer says `Esc to cancel`. The strip is a property of the
 * SURFACE (see `terminalSurface.ts`'s `keyStripShown`), never of which process is on the other end,
 * so the name no longer claims otherwise.
 *
 * A soft keyboard has no `esc`, no `tab` and no arrow keys at all — the cockpit already records the
 * last of those — so without this strip there is no way to leave `vim`, complete a path, or reach
 * the shell's history from a phone, and NO Ctrl+C at all. That is the whole reason the strip exists:
 * `esc tab ctrl ↑ ↓ ← →`, sitting above the system keyboard.
 *
 * `ctrl` is the only entry that sends nothing of its own. It is a STICKY MODIFIER: tap it, then type
 * a letter, and the letter becomes the control key instead. That is the only shape a soft keyboard
 * admits — there is no chord to hold — and it is why `ctrlKeyFor` exists rather than a row of
 * pre-composed `C-c` / `C-d` buttons: the letters worth reaching are the shell's, not a list this
 * module could guess.
 *
 * It answers `null` for a letter the channel does not accept rather than composing one it will
 * refuse. `C-z` (suspend) and `C-\` (SIGQUIT) are outside `KEY_ALLOWLIST` on purpose, and sending
 * one would earn a `bad_key` ack for a keystroke the person had every reason to expect to work —
 * the strip says so instead, which is the honest half of the same refusal.
 *
 * `paste` is the one entry that is CONDITIONAL. A phone has no Ctrl+V and no native paste gesture
 * into a canvas-rendered terminal, so without this the clipboard is unreachable from a soft
 * keyboard entirely. It needs `navigator.clipboard.readText()` — not every browser/context grants
 * that (it is permission- and HTTPS-gated) — so `stripEntries` takes the availability as a plain
 * boolean rather than reading `navigator` itself, which is what keeps this module PURE and
 * testable without a DOM.
