/**
 * taskSuggest.ts — PURE. Which delivery a new session in this folder probably belongs to.
 *
 * Filing happens at spawn or it mostly does not happen at all, and a field somebody has to fill in
 * from memory is a field they leave empty. So the form proposes one — and everything here exists to
 * make that proposal trustworthy rather than merely present:
 *
 *  - it is a SUGGESTION, never a default that is applied silently: the caller shows it filled in,
 *    says WHY, and offers to clear it;
 *  - it NEVER INVENTS. No evidence, or evidence that points two ways, yields `null` and an empty
 *    field. A wrong suggestion accepted without reading is worse than no suggestion, because it
 *    files work under a delivery nobody chose and the metrics of BOTH are then wrong.
 *
 * The rule is PLURALITY, not recency: a fleet row carries no timestamp (see `FleetRow` — the wire
 * has no `createdAt`), so "the most recent session's delivery" is not computable here. What the
 * browser can see is how many sessions of this exact folder are filed where, which is also exactly
 * what the reason sentence says out loud.

 * also seeded `subtaskTarget` — silently FILING the session under a delivery nobody had chosen.
 * `initialTask`/`initialTaskId`, passed explicitly by a caller that already created the delivery,
 * are a person's own choice made a moment earlier and are untouched by this — they seed `task`
 * directly, never through a suggestion.
 *
 * Only worth showing while the field is still EMPTY: a hint for a different delivery once someone
