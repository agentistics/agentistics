/**
 * lastSent.ts — PURE: which message was the last one the PERSON sent.
 *
 * "The last turn with `role: 'user'`" is the obvious reading and it is wrong, because that role is
 * not a claim that anybody typed anything. The transcript files a background task reporting back,
 * an injected system reminder, a `!` command's stdout and a slash command's caveat under the same
 * role — `ChatTurn.system` names which — and one of those was once circled in a screenshot with
 * "I didn't send that". A control that recalls "your last message" and shows a system reminder is
 * that same defect with a button on it.
 *
 * So this walks BACKWARDS and skips everything nobody wrote: system envelopes, background-task
 * status lines, and turns with no text (a turn that is only tool calls is work, not a message).
 *
 * AN ECHO WINS. A message that was delivered and has not reached the transcript yet is, by
 * construction, newer than anything in it — it is retired the instant the transcript carries the
 * same text. Reading past it would recall the message BEFORE the one just sent, which is the one
 * moment somebody is most likely to be looking for it.
 *
 * The answer is `null` where there is nothing, and the caller must then draw NO CONTROL. A button
 * that opens a modal saying "no messages" is a control that exists to refuse.
