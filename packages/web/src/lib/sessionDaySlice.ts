/**
 * sessionDaySlice.ts — PURE: what a session did INSIDE a date range.
 *
 * A session is a SPAN and its four counters are LIFETIME totals, so a date filter could only ever
 * file the whole of it somewhere. Both available answers are wrong and neither is a rounding error:
 *
 *   - on the day it STARTED — "today" is nearly empty for anyone whose session has been open since
 *     Tuesday, which is the normal way this product is used;
 *   - on every day it TOUCHES — measured at **86x** on a real machine, because seven sessions that
 *     merely reached into today brought 4.446.955.424 tokens with them against a true 51.465.608.
 *
 * `SessionMeta.daily` is the third answer, and it is a measurement rather than a rule: the parser
 * already walks every turn and every turn carries its own timestamp, so the split is real. This
 * module spends it.
 *
 * A SESSION WITHOUT `daily` KEEPS THE OLD RULE. The store is full of records written before that
 * field existed, and several harnesses' adapters do not produce it. Falling back to the whole
 * session for those would reintroduce the 86x on exactly the sessions that cannot be checked, so
 * they fall back to being filed on their start day — the answer this product has always given.
 *
 * Activity days use the local clock, matching the server parser on the user's machine.
 * Billing and tag projections keep their separate UTC contract.
