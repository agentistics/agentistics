/**
 * modeStyle.ts — PURE: what colour a harness mode wears.
 *
 * Asked for: the chip should change colour with the mode, so the state is readable without reading.
 *
 * THE GRADIENT IS AUTONOMY, NOT ALARM — how much the session proceeds without asking:
 *
 *   manual        nothing happens on its own          neutral, the chip's default look
 *   plan          it thinks and touches nothing        blue
 *   accept edits  it writes files without asking       orange
 *   auto          it does everything without asking    green
 *
 * NONE OF THEM IS THE FAULT COLOUR. `var(--accent-red)` is what a broken connection, an
 * unauthorized member and an offline machine wear, and `auto mode` is how this product is normally
 * used — painting the ordinary state red is the cry-wolf that `withheldStyle.ts` and the connection
 * pill's `stale` case both exist to avoid. A mode is a choice the user made, not a fault.
 *
 * AN UNKNOWN ID IS NEUTRAL, never a guess. A future claude release can add a mode, and this file
 * would learn about it from a bug report; a chip that is merely uncoloured still reads correctly,
 * while one wearing another mode's colour is a wrong answer given confidently.
