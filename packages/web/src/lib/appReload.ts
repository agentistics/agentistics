/**
 * appReload.ts — PURE (the decision) plus one total, guarded side effect: bringing the page back on
 * a bundle that was just published, without asking a person to press ctrl+shift+R.
 *
 * This app is a PWA, so a plain `location.reload()` is served by the SERVICE WORKER, which hands
 * back its cached copy of the bundle that was current when it last updated. That is why every
 * release so far has ended with "give it a hard reload first" — and why a reader who forgot tested
 * yesterday's code believing it was today's, which is the worst shape a verification can take.
 * `clearAppCaches` is what the keystroke actually does: unregister every worker, empty every cache,
 * and only then reload.
 *
 * The WAIT is the other half. `POST /api/upgrade` answers `started` and nothing more, because the
 * process that would say "done" is the one the upgrade restarts. So the page WATCHES: it polls
 * `/api/version` and reloads when the machine comes back naming the version it asked for. Every
 * failed poll in between is the ordinary case — the server really is down for a moment — and must
 * never be mistaken for an answer.
