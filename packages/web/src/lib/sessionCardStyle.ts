/**
 * sessionCardStyle.ts — how ONE session's card shows its state — PURE.
 *
 * Three modes, chosen by the person and stored in `sessionsAsidePrefs.ts`:
 *  - `wash`    — the card's whole background is tinted by the state's color, for all seven
 *    states. Before this module existed only `working`/`waiting`/`waiting-approval` got a tint
 *    and everything else read as plain, which made "the background follows the status" describe
 *    two different things depending on which status a row happened to be in.
 *  - `neutral` — the background stays plain; the state WORD (in the row's meta line) takes the
 *    state's color instead.
 *  - `stripe`  — the background stays plain, plus a colored left edge — the same visual language
 *    `TaskBoard`'s cards already use for their own status stripe.
 *
 * `selected` always wins, in every mode: a selected row's neutral, full-height edge is a fact
 * about where the READER is, and it must never compete with a fact about the SESSION — the same
 * rule `SessionsAside.tsx` states for why selection is not colored orange.
