/**
 * sessionPick.ts — PURE: the arithmetic of "tick some sessions and do a thing to them".
 *
 * Two features ask the same question and answer it differently, which is the whole reason this is
 * one module with a parameter rather than two lists:
 *
 *  - **Reopen what fell** starts every row TICKED. Putting the machine back the way it was is the
 *    common case, and the point of the list is that it is a default rather than the only answer.
 *  - **Broadcast a prompt** starts every row UNTICKED. Nothing here has a defensible "all": a
 *    default that types into every live session is a default that eventually types into one nobody
 *    meant.
 *
 * The rest — the header checkbox's three states, what the confirm button says, whether it is
 * pressable — is identical, and is here so it is tested once.
