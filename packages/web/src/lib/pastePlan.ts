/**
 * pastePlan.ts — PURE. What a paste into the composer should become.
 *
 * Three outcomes, and getting them apart is the whole job:
 *
 * - a paste carrying FILES (a screenshot from the clipboard, a drag from a file manager) becomes
 *   attachments;
 * - a paste of ORDINARY text goes into the field, which is what pasting means;
 * - a paste of a LOT of text becomes an attachment too, because the composer types its content into
 *   a tmux pane character by character. A 4.000-line paste is not a message, it is a file somebody
 *   had in the clipboard, and typing it would take minutes and land in the pane in pieces.
 *
 * Pure so the threshold is one number in one place with a test on it, rather than a condition
 * buried in an event handler where the only way to check it is to paste something.
 */

/**
 * Above this many characters, pasted text is attached instead of typed.
 *
 * Chosen against what the transport is: `sendKeysLiteralArgs` types the string into a pane. A few
 * thousand characters is a long message; five thousand (owner, 2026-10-10: a 7.000-character paste must chip) is a file. Erring high — an attachment the
 * user meant as a message is a worse surprise than a slow paste.
