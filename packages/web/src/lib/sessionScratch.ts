/**
 * sessionScratch.ts — what survives leaving a conversation and coming back.
 *
 * Two things did not, and both were reported:
 *
 *   1. "as conversas que eu ja abri, se eu saio e volto elas sao recarregadas novamente" — the chat
 *      view holds its payload in component state, so navigating away destroys it and returning
 *      paints an empty column until a fetch completes. The data is on this machine; the wait is
 *      pure ceremony.
 *   2. "se eu comeco a digitar aqui e vou pra outra pagina, eu perco todo o prompt que eu escrevi" —
 *      the composer's draft is component state too. Losing typed words to a click is the worst
 *      thing a text field can do, and it is the one thing here that CANNOT be recovered from the
 *      server: a conversation re-fetches, a paragraph the person wrote does not exist anywhere
 *      else.
 *
 * They get DIFFERENT storage, because they are different kinds of thing:
 *
 * - A DRAFT is the person's own words and nothing else has a copy, so it goes to `sessionStorage`
 *   and survives a reload as well as a navigation. Per tab, deliberately: two tabs open on one
 *   session are two people composing, and merging their keystrokes is not a feature.
 * - A CONVERSATION is a CACHE of something the server will hand back on request, so it stays in
 *   memory. Writing hundreds of turns per session into `sessionStorage` would spend a real quota
 *   on bytes that are one fetch away, and quota errors are silent in exactly the browsers where
 *   they happen.
 *
 * THE CACHED CONVERSATION IS NEVER THE ANSWER, only the first paint. The poll fires on mount as it
 * always did and replaces it; the cache removes the blank column in front of it, and nothing more.
 * That is why there is no staleness rule here — a cache whose maximum age is one request does not
 * need one.
 *
 * Every read and write is wrapped: `sessionStorage` THROWS on access in a browser set to block
 * site data, not merely returns null, and a composer that cannot be typed into because storage is
 * off would be a far worse bug than the one this fixes.

 * filed under the wrong name.
 *
 * ONE CONVERSATION IS REACHABLE THROUGH SEVERAL ROWS, by design. `session-view.ts` deliberately
 * lets an `exited` managed row NOT cover its conversation, so the conversation appears a second
 * time as a `closed:<conversationId>` row you can reopen — measured on this machine: 9 of the 12
 * exited rows had exactly that twin. And every attach / reopen / restart mints a NEW managedId for
 * the SAME conversation. So the row id is not an identity that survives a session's life, and
 * keying scratch on it means closing a session throws away its cached turns AND the paragraph
 * somebody had typed into it — which is the one thing here that exists nowhere else.
 *
 * The key is therefore the conversation where there is one (`closed:` rows carry it in their id and
 * nowhere else), and the row id only where there is not — a harness that cannot report a
