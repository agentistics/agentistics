/**
 * wizardSteps.ts — PURE: what the new-session wizard asks, in what order, and when it may advance.
 *
 * Separated from the rendering so "can I continue", "what is missing" and "what did they choose"
 * are answerable without a DOM. A wizard whose gating lives in JSX is a wizard nothing can check,
 * and this one gates the most powerful act the server performs.
 *
 * TWO RULES CARRIED OVER FROM THE TERMINAL WIZARD, both load-bearing:
 *
 * - The assistants offered are the ones `availableHarnesses()` found ON PATH. Anything else starts
 *   a tmux session that dies on `command not found` behind a screen nobody is watching.
 * - `model` and `effort` are SKIPPED, not shown-and-disabled, where the harness cannot take them.
 *   `efforts` is a closed set read from each CLI's own `--help`. A model question is skipped where
 *   the harness NAMES no models, even if it accepts `--model`: a dropdown whose only entry is "the
 *   assistant's default" is a control that cannot be used, while an absent one says "we cannot name
 *   these for you".
 *
 * THE TITLE IS REQUIRED, and it is the one answer of step 1 that is. A session is found again by
 * what it is CALLED — in the fleet list, in the search field, in `agentop session ls` — and the
 * harness-derived fallback names the conversation rather than the work ("Fixing the build" against
 * whatever Claude decided to call itself). Everything else on that step has a defensible unset
 * state the CLI resolves; a session nobody can pick out of a list of forty does not.
