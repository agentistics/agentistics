/**
 * fleetGroups.ts — which sub-group a fleet row belongs to, for the sessions aside — PURE.
 *
 * Project and Task reuse `groupSessions` in `@agentistics/tui/control/session-fleet` — the very
 * function the terminal cockpit and `agentop session ls` resolve their bands with. A second
 * implementation of "which band does this row belong to" is exactly the defect that module exists
 * to remove.
 *
 * Status is the one exception, and it is web-only on purpose. The shared `status` dimension in
 * `session-dimensions.ts` deliberately collapses `exited`/`lost`/`closed` into one `Off` bucket —
 * the "3 desligadas, wtf" fix, a decision made for the terminal's filter menu and tested there.
 * This aside groups by the raw `session.state` instead (seven distinct buckets), because that is
 * a different, purely visual arrangement question, and reusing the collapsed dimension would
 * either mislabel a merged bucket or reopen a decision this feature has no reason to touch.
 *
 * What lives here besides the grouping itself: the WORDS (this module deliberately owns none of
 * `groupSessions`'s own vocabulary, but Status needs its own, since it does not go through that
 * function), the rule that a band holding one group draws no heading, and the manual reordering a
 * person can apply on top of the automatic (most-urgent-first) order.
