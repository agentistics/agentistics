/**
 * pinnedSessions.ts — the up-to-three sessions a person keeps in sight.
 *
 * With a busy fleet the two or three sessions that matter right now scatter every time the grouping
 * changes. Pinning says "these I always want to hand": they sit in their own block at the top,
 * OUTSIDE the grouping, and survive a reload. The store is the persisted, shared source of truth
 * (localStorage + an external store), the same shape as `terminalZoom.ts`.
 *
 * WHERE IT LIVES: the SERVER, through `sharedPref.ts` — a pin is a fact about the WORK, not about
 * the screen it was made on, so the same dashboard opened from a phone, a tablet and the desktop
 * must show one pinned band. It was `localStorage`, which is per browser, so it showed three. That
 * module holds the first-paint and arming rules; nothing about them is restated here.
 *
 * The rules are deliberate and pinned by the pure `planPinToggle`:
 *  - a HARD limit (MAX_PINNED), and the one past it is REFUSED, never a silent swap — a swap
 *    surprises, a refusal is predictable;
 *  - pinning/unpinning is the ONLY thing that changes the set — a filter, a grouping or a search
 *    never touches it, and a pinned session that dies stays pinned (shown as ended) until the person
 *    unpins it, so a slot is never taken away behind their back.

 * fleet outright, not merely ended — see `resolvePinnedRows`'s own note on why an ENDED one is kept
 * on purpose). The band the person drags in only ever shows the RESOLVED, filtered rows, so the
 * only identity a drag gesture can name is a KEY, never a position — a position in the filtered
 * list does not correspond to the same position in this raw one the instant one entry in front of
 * it fails to resolve. This replaced an index-based `planPinMove(current, from, to)` for exactly
 * that reason: the caller had only a filtered-list index to offer it, so a drag from filtered
 * position 0 to filtered position 2 was applied as raw index 0 to raw index 2 — a different pair of
 * ids whenever anything ahead of them did not resolve, which read as "the order reverts" because
 * the two entries that actually moved were invisible either way.
 *
 * Total — a key this list does not hold, dragged or dropped, is refused unchanged (see
 * `reorderByDrag`). Membership is never touched here: only `planPinToggle` adds or removes.

 * from it, so the caller must pass the UNNARROWED fleet. A pinned row that finished while the
 * person was away is exactly the case this exists for: `activeOnly` (on by default in the
 * Sessions workspace) used to cut `pinnedRows` from the same already-`activeOnly`-filtered list
 * the bands read, which silently dropped a pinned session the instant it finished — "pin it,
 * leave, come back, it's gone" needed no reload and no id change to reproduce, only the pinned
