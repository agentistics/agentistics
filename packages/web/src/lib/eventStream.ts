/**
 * eventStream.ts — ONE shared `/api/events` EventSource for the whole app.
 *
 * The dashboard's push channel `/api/events` carries several event TYPES: `change` (the server wrote
 * new session data → refetch) and `notification` (a new bell/toast → re-read the scoped list). Each
 * consumer used to open its OWN `EventSource('/api/events')` — `useData` and `useNotificationStream`
 * both did — so an idle Sessions page held TWO live sockets to the same URL before a single terminal
 * was opened. That matters: a browser caps how many connections one origin may hold at once (~6 over
 * HTTP/1.1), each live terminal spends one (`/api/fleet/stream`), and a socket wasted on a duplicate
 * broadcast is one fewer a maximised terminal can have — which is exactly how a terminal ends up
 * queued behind the limit, stuck "connecting" forever.
 *
 * So this module owns a SINGLE, ref-counted EventSource: the first subscriber opens it, every later
 * one shares it, and it closes only when the last subscriber leaves. Subscribers register by event
 * TYPE and receive the raw `MessageEvent`; there is one native listener per type, fanned out to that
 * type's handler set. The EventSource factory is injectable so the pure ref-counting can be tested
 * without a real socket. EventSource's own auto-reconnect is left untouched — a dropped `/api/events`
 * comes back on its own, exactly as it did per-hook.

/**
 * A code-split bundle DUPLICATES this module into several chunks — measured on the production
 * build, `useData`, `index` and `ConnectionSettings` each carried their own copy. A plain
 * module-level `const` is then a PER-COPY singleton: `useData`'s copy opens one `/api/events`
 * socket and the notification hook's copy (in `index`) opens a SECOND, which is exactly the
 * double-connection this module exists to remove (verified in the browser: 2 live sockets on the
 * production dashboard before this). So the ONE instance is anchored on `globalThis` — the first
 * duplicated copy to run creates it, every other copy reuses it, giving a true cross-chunk
 * singleton and one socket. `createEventStream` stays a pure factory (the tests drive it directly);
 * only the app-wide instance is shared this way.
