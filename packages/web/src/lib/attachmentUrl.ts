 * `ATTACHMENT_DIR_MARK` is a GUESS at the default layout (`~/.agentistics/attachments/`), right for
 * almost every install — it stops being right the moment `AGENTISTICS_DIR` relocates the data
 * directory, because the real path then carries no `.agentistics` segment at all and the substring
 * guess never matches. A `viewed` file inside the (relocated) attachments directory then read as
 * one the SESSION wrote instead of one the attachments route can serve — routed through the
 * artifacts allowlist, which refuses it — and the gallery reported a file that was right there as
 * "não está mais no disco". `null` until the server has said otherwise, which is when the guess is
 * used; a server always agrees with its own client, so this is set at most once per page load.
