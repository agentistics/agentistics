 *
 * A row's id is not always a token. `external:<harness>:<cwd>:<startedMs>` carries a DIRECTORY, and
 * a directory has slashes:
 *
 *     external:antigravity:/home/mithrandir/agentistics:1788625485620
 *
 * Interpolated raw into `/sessions/${id}`, those slashes become PATH SEPARATORS. The route is
 * `/sessions/:id`, which matches one segment, so nothing matched and the page rendered blank —
 * "tem uma external que se eu clicar nela ela crasha a aplicacao". Navigating to the same row with
 * the id encoded works, which is why it was invisible to anything that built the URL by hand.
 *
 * So the encoding happens HERE, in one function every caller goes through, rather than at five
 * `navigate()` sites where the sixth will forget. `useParams` decodes on the way back in, so
 * nothing downstream changes.
 *
 * The id is NOT reshaped to avoid the problem: `externalId()` composes it from the facts that
 * identify an external process, and a row's identity is not the place to make a routing concern
 * disappear.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHERE A REOPEN LANDS, and how long the page may say a session is on its way.
//
// A reopen mints a NEW managed row and retires the one it was asked about, so the id in the URL
// stops naming anything the moment it succeeds. Two separate things went wrong there, and only
// together do they produce what was reported — "reabro uma sessão e ele me joga pra tela de
// sessions":
//
//   1. THE NEW ID WAS THROWN AWAY on two of the four surfaces that can reopen. The composer's own
//      Reopen button (`SessionChat`) and the aside's row menu both called the action and kept only
//      its message, on the stated belief that "the page follows it there". Nothing followed it: the
//      URL still held the retired id, `collapseSupersededSessions` dropped that row on the next
//      poll, and the page fell through to its "nothing selected" branch — the fleet overview —
//      permanently.
//
//   2. THE "IT IS ON ITS WAY" GUARD WAS SCOPED TO THE MOUNT. `creatingSince` was a `useState`
//      initialised once and never reset, so the budget it measured against started when the page
//      was OPENED. Creating a session from the overview remounts the page (a different `<Route>`),
//      which is why it always looked right; reopening from inside a session is `/sessions/A` ->
//      `/sessions/B`, the SAME route, no remount — so on any page open longer than the budget the
//      guard was already spent and the overview showed anyway, for the whole poll interval.
//
// Both halves live here so the four call sites cannot each answer differently — the same reason
// `sessionPath` exists rather than five hand-built URLs.
