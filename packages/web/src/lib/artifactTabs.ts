/**
 * artifactTabs.ts — PURE: what the artifacts panel's three tabs contain.
 *
 * FILES is everything the session wrote that is still a readable file with content — the server
 * decides that, because only it can look at the disk.
 *
 * DOCS is the subset somebody would READ rather than run: specs, plans, notes, READMEs. It is a
 * subset and never a separate list, so a document cannot be in one tab and missing from the other.
 * The rule is the EXTENSION plus a small set of names, because that is what can be decided without
 * opening the file — guessing at "is this a spec" from a path's words would file
 * `packages/server/spec-runner.ts` under documentation.
 *
 * LIVE is the activity, in order: what the session read, wrote, ran, thought and delegated. It is
 * built from the same turns the conversation renders, so it can never claim something the
 * transcript does not show. Each entry says WHICH KIND it is, because "read a file" and "ran a
 * command" are different events and a single grey list of strings is a log, not a view.
