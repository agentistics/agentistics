/**
 * promptCount.ts — PURE. How many characters are in the box, said the way a person counts them.
 *
 * `String.length` is UTF-16 CODE UNITS, so `🙂` reads as 2 and a flag emoji as 4. Nobody typing one
 * thinks they typed two, and this number sits directly beside the field it describes — it is the
 * one figure in the product a reader can check by eye, so being off by one on a smiley is not a
 * rounding difference, it is the counter being wrong in front of them. Iterating the string counts
 * CODE POINTS, which is what matches the caret for everything anyone types here.
 *
 * (Grapheme clusters would be closer still — a family emoji is several code points joined by
 * zero-width joiners — and `Intl.Segmenter` is how you would do it. It is deliberately not used:
 * it is not in every browser this dashboard opens in, and the failure mode of the fallback is a
 * counter that silently disagrees with itself between machines. One rule everywhere beats a better
 * rule in some places, for a number whose whole job is to be predictable.)
