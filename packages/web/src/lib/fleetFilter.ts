/**
 * fleetFilter.ts — PURE. Applying an explicit session scope to the LIVE fleet.
 * Session surfaces use `SESSION_LIST_FILTERS`; metric header filters must never scope their rows.
 *
 * The filters were built to scope METRICS — a date range, a set of projects, a set of models. A
 * fleet is not metrics: it is what is running now. So only the dimensions that mean something about
 * a live session are applied, and the rest are ignored ON PURPOSE:
 *
 * - `dateRange` / `customStart` / `customEnd` — a live session is happening now, and "last 7 days"
 *   would silently hide a session that started eight days ago and is still working.
 * - `users` / `teams` / `machines` / `presence` — every row here is on THIS machine by definition;
 *   the fleet route is refused on a central.
 * - `tags` — a tag resolves to a set of stored sessions server-side, and a live row is not in that
 *   set until its metrics are written.
 *
 * What IS applied: harness, project, repository, model — each a fact the row carries itself.
 *
 * `activeOnly` is the fleet's OWN dimension and lives here rather than in `Filters`, because the
 * dashboard has no use for it: it is a statement about what a session is doing right now.
 *
 * `withheld` is returned alongside, because a filter that narrows silently is one people conclude
 * is broken when the list looks short — and on this surface a hidden row can be a session waiting
 * for a person.

 * FLEET: what runs on this machine now, plus the conversations it can reopen. Those are different
 * universes, and the gap is not small — on a real machine the metrics knew six harnesses while the
 * fleet held three.
 *
 * So the bar offered "antigravity", and picking it emptied the list. Nothing was broken: there
 * genuinely were no antigravity rows to keep. But a filter that offers a value it can only ever
 * answer "nothing" to is indistinguishable from one that is failing, and it was reported as exactly
 * that. An option is a promise that something might be behind it.
 *
 * Derived from the rows themselves, so the promise is always true. Repos are reported in BOTH
 * shapes for the same reason `matchesRepo` accepts both: the chip the user clicks may have come

 * this module ignores is a control that does nothing. `fleetFilter.test.ts` cross-checks them.

 * ALSO drawn as a chip while it is on, so it could be turned OFF from the chip's × and then never
