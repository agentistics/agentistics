/**
 * artifactLayout.ts — PURE: where the artifacts panel goes, and what that costs the fleet list.
 *
 * Opening the panel COLLAPSES the session list to its rail, and the width comes from where it was
 * not being read: at the moment somebody opens a file to read it, the list is the least consulted
 * thing on screen. Measured at 1440px — list 248, rail 64, panel 440 — that is 936px of
 * conversation instead of 752.
 *
 * ONE CLICK DOING TWO THINGS is normally a defect, so the reversal sticks: `listExpandedByUser`
 * means the person opened the list back up with the panel open, and their choice WINS for as long
 * as it is set. The layout then degrades to a plain three-column split, which is the honest
 * arrangement it would have had anyway.
 *
 * Below `SPLIT_MIN_WIDTH` there is no room for three columns and the choice stops existing: the
 * panel becomes an overlay, and nothing is collapsed — collapsing a list the layout is not using
 * would be taking something for nothing.

 * ta executando algo, automaticamente a barra deveria aparecer" — and then asked to stop, in the
 * same words that explain why: "a barra de contents ta abrindo sozinha as vezes, nao quero que isso
 * aconteça… se for pra indicar que tem algo acontecendo quero que apenas apareça um
 * componentenzinho".
 *
 * Both asks want the same thing. Knowing that something is happening is worth a lot; being pushed
 * out of the conversation you are reading, by a panel that takes half the width, costs more than it
 * is worth — and it happens over and over, because a session writes files all day.
 *
 * So the announcement is the strip at the top of the conversation (`edgeHint` below), which says
 * what is being written or run and opens the panel on the LIVE feed when pressed. The rule is not
 * kept "just in case": an uncalled rule is one somebody calls again.
