/**
 * sessionStats.ts — PURE: the numbers behind ONE session, and which of them this harness can
 * actually produce.
 *
 * The dashboard has a stats strip for the whole machine; this is the same idea for the conversation
 * you have open — how full its context is, what it has spent, how much of the talking was yours,
 * how many subagents it ran, what it changed in the repository.
 *
 * TWO RULES CARRY THE WHOLE FILE, and both come from `HARNESS_CAPABILITIES`:
 *
 * 1. A METRIC THIS HARNESS CANNOT PRODUCE IS `null`, NEVER 0. Gemini reports no tokens; Codex
 *    reports no agents. A confident `0` beside real figures is read as "it did nothing", which is a
 *    different and false statement from "this cannot be measured here". The panel renders `null` as
 *    N/A with the harness's own reason.
 * 2. A CONVERSATION THE STORE HAS NOT SEEN YET IS `null` TOO — not zero. A session started ten
 *    seconds ago has no record; saying it has spent nothing would be true only by accident, and
 *    wrong a minute later.
 *
 * The context gauge is `contextFraction` from `@agentistics/core` and inherits its rule unchanged:
 * a fraction exists only when BOTH the measurement and the window are known, the window is never
 * guessed from a model id that is not in the table, and the value is NOT clamped — a session really
 * can exceed the documented window, so the bar saturates while the label keeps saying 106%.
