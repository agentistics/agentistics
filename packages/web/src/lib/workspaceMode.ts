 * workspaceMode.ts — which of the two applications the sidebar is showing.
 *
 * The dashboard and the session cockpit are not two pages, they are two workspaces: the aside keeps
 * its shell — width, header, footer, identity — and swaps its BODY. One sidebar component with two
 * bodies, never two sidebars, because a second implementation of the same chrome is a second thing
 * to drift.
 *
 * THE MODE IS DERIVED FROM THE URL, never held beside it. A `useState` mode plus a router is two
 * answers to one question, and they disagree the first time someone reloads the page, opens a link,
 * or presses back. Deriving it means F5 keeps you where you were and a session link can be sent to
 * somebody — which is the whole reason `Sessions` stops being a nav item and becomes a mode: a mode
 * you cannot link to is a mode you cannot share.
