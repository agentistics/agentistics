/**
 * taskSharing.ts — PURE. What sharing a delivery actually does, said in words.
 *
 * The switch is one click and its consequence is text on somebody else's server, so the sentence
 * beside it is not decoration: it is the only place a person learns WHAT travels (a title, a
 * description, comments, the NAMES of files), what does not (the files themselves, the claim, any
 * number this machine computed) and what is decided elsewhere (the sessions, by the repository
 * rules this connection already has — sharing a delivery can never widen them).
 *
 * Three states, and the third is the one that would otherwise mislead: a machine connected to no
 * central can turn the switch on and nothing travels, which must be SAID rather than left to look
 * like a share that happened.
