/**
 * headerFit.ts — PURE: what the unified top strip gives up when it runs out of width, and in which
 * order.
 *
 * The strip holds, left to right: the session's title, the filter controls, the view tabs and the
 * actions. Three of those four are the answer to "what am I looking at" and "how do I act on it";
 * only the filters have a second home — every dimension they drop is still in the `+ Filtro`
 * popover, and the date range is still whatever it already was. So the filters are what shrinks,
 * and this module is the one place that decides how far.
 *
 * IT SHRINKS RATHER THAN CLIPS. The strip's middle is `overflow: hidden`, which is what stops it
 * painting over the view tabs (reported at 1920: the "Chat" label rendered on top of itself). But a
 * clipped control is worse than an overlapping one — it is simply unreachable, with nothing on
 * screen saying so. So the middle must give width back BEFORE the clip bites, and the date block is
 * what gives: `full` is the four presets plus the from/to range; `compact` is one button carrying
 * the range that is in force, which opens both.
 *
 * The thresholds are DERIVED from the controls' own metrics in `FiltersBar` (`CTL`: 12px text,
 * 10px horizontal padding, 1px border, 30px tall; 3px between presets, 8px between groups), not
 * read off a screenshot. Being a few pixels out costs one extra state change at one width; it
 * cannot make the strip wrong.

/**
 * THE FLOOR THE SLOT MUST HOLD, and the thing this module could not enforce on its own.
 *
 * "It shrinks rather than clips" is only true down to the narrowest tier's own width. Below that
 * there is no tier left to choose, and the bar — `flexWrap: nowrap`, `maxWidth: 100%` — cannot
 * wrap, cannot clip and cannot compact any further, so its controls simply crush into each other:
 * the padding goes, the gaps go, and the `+` ends up welded to the button beside it. Reported from
 * a tablet with eleven filters applied, which is the exact case the tiers budget for.
 *
 * The slot that hosts the bar carried `minWidth: 90` — 122px under this. So the strip kept taking
 * width the bar had already run out of ways to give. Handing the slot THIS number instead makes
 * the floor the one `headerFit` already decided, and what gives up the remaining width is the
 * TITLE, which ellipsises: a name cut short is still a name, while a jammed control row is a set
 * of buttons nobody can tell apart.
 *
 * It is `ICON_BOTH_BAR_W` and not something smaller for the reason the tiers are measured at their
 * widest: "see active filters" exists only while something is filtering, and a floor that fits only
 * an unfiltered bar is a floor that fails the moment somebody filters.

/**
 * How much of the centring padding the strip can actually AFFORD.
 *
 * The filters sit in a `flex: 1` slot between the logo and the action cluster, and the slot is
 * padded on the left by the cluster's own width so the bar lands on the STRIP's centre line rather
 * than the centre of what is left beside it. That padding is real: it comes out of the width the
 * bar has to draw in.
 *
 * Which means the cluster was charged TWICE — once for being a sibling that takes room, and once
 * again as padding. On a 1273px window with a 258px cluster that is 516px gone, and the bar
 * compacted with most of the header empty beside it. Reported with a screenshot of exactly that.
 *
 * CENTRING IS WHAT GIVES WAY, NOT THE CONTROLS. The padding is a nicety — a bar a few pixels off
 * the centre line is something nobody notices, while a date control collapsed into a popover is a
 * control somebody has to go looking for. So the padding is taken only out of the SLACK: whatever
 * is left after the bar has room for its widest layout, and never more than the cluster's own
 * width. Below that the bar is simply not centred, and it still compacts in the order this module
 * already sets — just later, and only when the width is genuinely gone.
