/**
 * noteFocus.ts — PURE: which row a chat note's chip asked for, and what to say when there is none.
 *
 * A system note names a KIND (`a skill was loaded`), so its chip could only ever open the aside tab
 * and leave the reader hunting the list — the limitation CLAUDE.md records for `command output`,
 * and until now the reality for skills too, whose body named the skill all along. The server now
 * carries that identity as `ChatTurn.systemRef`, `openArtifacts(tab, ref)` already carried a
 * reference for the live feed, and this holds the two rules both lists answer.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE INVENTS A MATCH. An absent reference focuses nothing and the list looks exactly as
 * it always has; a reference no row carries is REPORTED, because a tab that opens and highlights
 * nothing is indistinguishable from a button that did not work.
