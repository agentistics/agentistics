/**
 * repoErrorText.ts — PURE. What a repository-explorer failure SAYS, in the reader's language.
 *
 * `repoApi.ts` is deliberately wordless: it carries the server's own already-localized `message`
 * through untouched and never invents one. That leaves exactly two kinds of failure with nothing to
 * show a reader, and this module is the ONE place either is turned into a sentence — the same split
 * `shellBand.ts` already makes for the utility shell, mirrored here on purpose:
 *
 *  - **The PRE-HANDLER GATES.** `index.ts` refuses `/api/fleet/tree*` before `editor-web.ts` can
 *    compose anything, answering `{error: 'editor_disabled'}` (the switch is off). It carries a CODE and no prose, so
 *    the UI owns the wording.
 *  - **`unreachable`.** Nothing came back that honours the contract, so there is no server sentence
 *    to show at all. The three causes stay three sentences: "nothing answered", "it is answering,
 *    just not in time" and "something answered and it was not this" send a reader somewhere
 *    different.
 *
 * Everything else — every refusal `editor-web.ts` itself decided — is shown VERBATIM. Re-wording a
 * sentence the server already wrote in the reader's language would be a second source for one fact,
 * and the two would drift.
 *
 * AN UNKNOWN CODE IS SHOWN AS ITSELF, exactly as `shellErrorText` does: a reason nobody can read
 * still beats a blank box, which is the confident-nothing this codebase refuses everywhere.
