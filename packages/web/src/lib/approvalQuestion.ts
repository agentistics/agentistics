/**
 * approvalQuestion.ts — PURE: which part of a dialog's screen is the QUESTION.
 *
 * THE CARD SHOWED EVERYTHING AND THEREFORE SHOWED NOTHING. `ApprovalCard` rendered the captured
 * frame whole, in an 11px dimmed monospace block — the question, then every option with its full
 * description, then the `────` rule, then the harness's own footer (`Enter to select · ↑/↓ to
 * navigate · Esc to cancel`) — and then drew the same options AGAIN underneath as buttons. So the
 * one line that is NOT duplicated by the buttons, the question itself, was a line among twenty in
 * the smallest and faintest text on the card. Reported three times, in these words: "não consigo
 * ver o enunciado da pergunta dele".
 *
 * The comment defending the raw block was right about permission prompts — a person agreeing to a
 * command has to read the command, and a button label does not carry it. It inverts for a question
 * with named options: there the labels ARE the buttons, so the block becomes a duplicate that
 * buries the only thing it alone carried.
 *
 * THE SPLIT IS THE FIRST OPTION. Everything above `1.` is what was being asked — the question, and
 * on a permission prompt the command being asked about. Everything from `1.` down is the option
 * list and the terminal's own chrome, which the buttons already say. Nothing is discarded: the card
 * keeps the whole frame behind a disclosure, unchanged, so what a person agrees to is always
 * readable in full.
 *
 * TOTAL, and conservative in the direction that cannot lose text. A frame with no numbered option
 * (codex's `Press enter to continue`) has NO question part and keeps the whole frame as it was —
 * inventing a split there would promote an arbitrary first line into a heading.

/**
 * Undo the TERMINAL's wrapping — and only the terminal's.
 *
 * A boxed question is wrapped at the box width, so its breaks are an artefact of the column and a
 * sentence arrives cut in half ("…antes ou depois" / "do fechamento contabil?"). Joining every line
 * would be wrong in the other direction: a permission prompt puts the COMMAND on its own line
 * inside the same box, and a command joined onto the sentence above it is unreadable and, worse,
 * misquoted.
 *
 * So a line is joined to the one before it only when that one was FULL — within `FULL_SLACK` of the
 * BOX WIDTH. And the box width is measured over the WHOLE frame, never over the question alone: the
 * box is one column that the options and the `────` rule are drawn at too, so the frame is where it
 * is visible. Measuring the question slice instead makes its own longest line the ceiling, which is
 * how a two-line prompt "proves" its first line was wrapped no matter how short the box really was.
 *
 * A command that genuinely fills the column WAS wrapped by the terminal, and joining it back is
 * restoring it, not corrupting it. It errs toward NOT joining: an unjoined line is the status quo,
 * a wrongly joined one changes what a person reads before they agree to it.

/**
 * The IDENTITY of the dialog currently on screen — what makes "this is still the same question"
 * true across two reads, and what makes "this is a DIFFERENT question" true too.
 *
 * MEASURED ROOT CAUSE (2026-09-28): both `ApprovalCard`'s "already answered from here" guard and
 * the composer's "still answering this dialog" check used to compare OPTIONS ALONE
 * (`options.map(o => \`${o.number}:${o.label}\`).join('\n')`). That is not an identity for claude's
 * commonest dialog: its PERMISSION PROMPT is the fixed template `1. Yes / 2. Yes, allow all edits
 * during this session (shift+tab) / 3. No` on every Bash/Edit/Write call, whatever the command —
 * `approval-spec.ts` documents that exact wording. So the FIRST permission prompt answered from a
 * session set `answeredShape` to that template, and EVERY LATER ONE — a wholly different command —
 * compared equal to it forever, because nothing in the session ever changes `answeredShape` back.
 * The buttons went inert and stayed inert, which reads as the card ignoring every click and is
 * reported exactly that way: "sometimes it just keeps showing the interactive question" (it was a
 * NEW question, disabled by the memory of the last one) and, silently, "sometimes it doesn't send
 * at all" (a disabled button throws no error and shows no message).
 *
 * The fix folds the QUESTION half back in — everything `splitApprovalFrame` puts above `1.`, which
 * on a permission prompt is the actual command and is exactly what differs between two prompts that
 * share a template. The OPTION rows are still summarised by number and label rather than included
 * verbatim, so a cursor merely moving between them (no keystroke of ours involved on a marker-style
 * dialog mid-resolution) cannot flip the identity — see `ApprovalCard`'s own `DialogOption.selected`,
 * which this deliberately ignores.
