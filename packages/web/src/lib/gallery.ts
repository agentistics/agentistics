/**
 * gallery.ts — PURE: the files the PERSON SENT, grouped by the message that carried them.
 *
 * THE GALLERY IS NOT THE ARTIFACTS. `sessionArtifacts.ts` answers "what did this session WRITE";
 * this answers "what did I SEND it". They are opposite directions and share nothing but the panel
 * they are drawn in — a screenshot pasted into the composer is not a file the assistant produced,
 * and filing it under Files would be a claim about the session's work that nobody made.
 *
 * THE GROUPING IS THE FEATURE. Several images routinely go up in one message — three screenshots of
 * one broken layout — and a flat wall of thumbnails loses the one thing that makes them readable:
 * that they were sent TOGETHER, about the same thing, with the same sentence under them. So the
 * unit here is the MESSAGE, not the file, and every list in the panel is a list of messages whose
 * rows happen to be files.
 *
 * WHAT AN ATTACHMENT IS is decided by `messageAttachments.ts` and nothing here re-derives it: the
 * composer types a line into a tmux pane, so a sent message is attachment paths on their own
 * leading lines followed by the typed text, and `splitMessage` is the one rule that takes them
 * apart. WHO SENT IT is decided by `lastSent.ts`'s `isPersonMessage`, for the same reason it exists
 * there: the transcript files background tasks, injected reminders and `!` command output under the
 * user's own role, and a gallery of "what I sent" that included those would be showing somebody
 * their own avatar over something they never wrote.
 *
 * IT ONLY READS THE COMMITTED TRANSCRIPT. A message still in flight (the chat's `echo` list) is
 * deliberately absent: it lands in the transcript within a poll or two and arrives here then, and
 * an entry that cannot be anchored to a rendered turn is one whose "go to the message" has nowhere
 * to go.
