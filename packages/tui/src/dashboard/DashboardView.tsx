/**
 * DashboardView — the metrics dashboard itself, drawn wherever it is asked for.
 *
 * ONE implementation, mounted by the control center's `dashboard` tab. It briefly had two entry
 * points — this and the standalone `agentop tui` — and that command is an alias now, because the
 * second one owned nothing but a duplicate of the chrome around these screens. Nothing here owns a
 * screen, a column, a key or a budget: a second copy of them is the bug this repo has already paid
 * for once (see `task-reopen.ts`), and it would show up as two surfaces quietly disagreeing about
 * what a session cost.
 *
 * What it does NOT do is fetch. The data arrives as a prop, because the server is the thing the
 * screen next door starts and stops: the tab reads the address the host already reported and says so
 * in words when there is nothing to read. Absence is stated, never rendered as a zero.
