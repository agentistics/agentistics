/**
 * session-dimensions.ts — PURE. The ONE table of things a session can be grouped by and filtered on.
 *
 * ## Why it is one table
 *
 * Grouping was a hand-written union (`'none' | 'harness' | 'model' | 'project' | 'task' | 'repo'`)
 * and filtering was a separate, differently-shaped thing beside it (`states`, `onlyActive`,
 * `showClosed`, `showExited`, `showUnfiled`, a task scope and a project scope). Two lists of the same
 * set of facts, maintained by hand, in different places — exactly the pattern CLAUDE.md forbids for
 * harnesses ("never hardcode a harness list anywhere else — five places used to, and TypeScript
 * accepts an array literal with a member missing"), and it failed the same way: adding `status` meant
 * remembering two places, and whoever forgot one shipped a dimension that groups but cannot filter.
 *
 * So there is one `Record<SessionDimensionId, SessionDimension>`, the build breaks until a new
 * dimension is declared, and **grouping and filtering both read the same `keyOf`**. That is not a
 * tidiness argument: with two derivations, the chip "status: waiting" and the band "waiting" drift
 * into showing different sets and nothing in the build complains. `session-dimensions.test.ts`
 * cross-checks it for every dimension and every bucket — filtering to one bucket must return exactly
 * the rows that bucket's band contains.
 *
 * ## The two defects this replaces
 *
 * **One dimension owned by two controls, and one of them silently won.** The show switches
 * (`only active`, `closed conversations`, `finished sessions`) and the state section both decided
 * which lifecycle states the list contained, and the state section was the whole answer whenever it
 * was present — so the switches changed nothing while continuing to draw their own on/off. Measured
 * on the reporting machine: `onlyActive: true` on screen, `62 of 65` sessions listed, nearly all of
 * them closed or ended. Ordering the switches differently does not fix a control that lies.
 *
 * Now there is exactly one piece of state for the dimension — the status selection — and the
 * switches are SHORTCUTS that write into it and read their on/off back OUT of it. They cannot
 * disagree, because there is nothing left to disagree about. The visible consequence is the point:
 * ticking "closed conversations" while "only active" is on widens the selection, and "only active"
 * turns ITSELF off, because it no longer describes the list.
 *
 * **The named-row exception was invisible.** A row the user renamed, noted or filed under a task
 * passed the history switches unconditionally. It exists for a real reason — a reboot turns every
 * managed session `lost`, and without it the default list came back empty, taking the names with it
 * — but an unwritten widening is the same class of defect as the switches above. It is now the
 * `showNamed` switch: off as it ships, so the filter applies to everyone, and a widening someone
 * chose and can see when it is on.
 *
 * It widens the STATUS dimension only. Generalising it to every dimension would let a named row
 * escape a project or repo filter, which is not an exception anyone asked for and would make those
 * filters lie in the same way.
