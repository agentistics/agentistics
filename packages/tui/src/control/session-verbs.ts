 * something. Both asked at a moment nobody was thinking about a delivery — so they were pressed by
 * accident, and the one that mattered (finishing) was a switch somebody had to remember to flip,
 * which left deliveries open long after their last session ended.
 *
 * The question moved to the one moment the answer is in the reader's head: stopping a session that
 * is filed under a delivery asks whether the delivery is finished (`StopSessionConfirm`). Reopening
