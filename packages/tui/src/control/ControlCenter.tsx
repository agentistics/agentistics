/**
 * ControlCenter — the one component mounted for the whole `agentop` session.
 *
 * Everything the user does here is a state transition inside this tree: screens, questions and
 * text prompts never mount a second Ink app and never print a line. That is the entire reason the
 * control center exists — the old launcher re-rendered once per step and grew the scrollback
 * forever.
 *
 * The shell owns what must survive a screen switch (the status, the last action's outcome, the
 * scroll position of each read-only screen) and nothing else. Every screen stays mounted and is
 * hidden with `display="none"` rather than unmounted, so coming back to one finds it exactly as it
 * was — a remount would reset the Logs viewport and the cockpit's own wizard on every glance
 * elsewhere.
 *
 * The chrome is six rows and no more, in reading order: the title, a blank, the tab bar, its
 * accent rule, then — under the body — the status line and the footer. It used to be eight: a
 * two-row wordmark, a mode sentence and a two-row tab strip, which on a 24-row terminal was a third
 * of the screen spent telling the user what they had just typed.
