 *    one page the name sits a band or two above and plainly governs the bands under it, so it is
 *    said once; across a break it is gone, and a card under no name does not say what it belongs
 *    to. The repeated heading carries the group's own count, not the count on this page — it is the
 *    same statement the list makes, and the pager already says how much of the fleet is on screen.
 *
 * `headed: false` — a grouping of `none`, or a band too short to spend a row on a name — packs the
 * whole fleet as one nameless group, which is exactly the dense grid this screen drew before.
 *
 * Each band is also SIZED here, to the tallest card in it and no taller, which is why the rows it
