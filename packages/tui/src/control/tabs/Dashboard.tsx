/**
 * Dashboard.tsx — the metrics dashboard, as a screen of the control center.
 *
 * It renders nothing of its own: the six screens, their strip and their keys are `DashboardView`
 * and `useDashboardNav`. What lives HERE is only what is true of being a tab — where the data
 * comes from, when it may be read, and which keys are left after the shell has taken its own.
 *
 * WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM is the one deliberate difference from the standalone app that used to
 * draw these screens (`agentop tui`, an alias for this one now). That command started a server for
 * itself when none was listening; this screen is inside the application that STARTS AND
 * STOPS that server, so it starts nothing. It reads the address off `ControlStatus.services` — the
 * host has already probed it — and when there is no address it says so in a sentence naming the
 * screen that fixes it. Zeros drawn under a stopped server would be the confident-0 this codebase
 * refuses everywhere else.
 *
 * WHEN IT MAY BE READ: only while it is the visible tab. The shell keeps every screen mounted
 * (`display: none`) so state survives a glance elsewhere — which would otherwise mean an SSE
 * connection held open and the whole payload re-read every few seconds behind a screen nobody is
 * looking at.
