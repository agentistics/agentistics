/**
 * Sessions.tsx — the fleet, on one screen.
 *
 * This screen knows nothing about tmux, `/proc` or what a harness prints: every session and every
 * word describing it arrives from `host.sessions()` already decided and already localized, exactly
 * as the services list arrives from `host.refresh()`. What it owns is the arrangement — which rows
 * fit, how they group, which one the cursor is on — and all of that arithmetic lives in the pure
 * `sessions.ts` beside it.
 *
 * The screen exists to answer one question at a glance: which of these is waiting for me. So the
 * ordering puts that first, the state word is the last cell given up under width pressure, and the
 * counter it feeds is drawn in the header where it is readable from every other tab.
