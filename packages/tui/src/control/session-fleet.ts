/**
 * session-fleet.ts — PURE fleet SEMANTICS: what a row IS, how rows are searched, grouped, ordered

 *
 * Split out of `sessions.ts` so the WEB dashboard can import the same answers the terminal cockpit
 * resolves against. `sessions.ts` is where the terminal GEOMETRY lives, and geometry is what makes
 * it unimportable: it takes `PANE_FRAME_Y` from `chrome.ts`, `chrome.ts` takes `truncate` from
 * `../components/Primitives`, and that imports Ink — so one such import puts a terminal renderer in
 * the browser bundle, where Vite cannot resolve it.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE HOLDS: nothing here may take a `width` or a row count, and nothing here may
 * import `./chrome`, `./surface` or `./i18n` at VALUE level. A measurement belongs one module over.
 * `session-purity.test.ts` asserts it over this module's own source, so the build fails rather than
 * the browser.
 *
 * `sessions.ts` re-exports every name below, so no existing importer changed.
