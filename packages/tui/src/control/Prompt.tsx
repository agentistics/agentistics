/**
 * Prompt — the text / confirm primitives, replacing `server/cli-ui.ts` on the TTY path (that
 * module stays as the non-TTY fallback).
 *
 * The editing is written out by hand rather than pulled from `ink-text-input`: the compiled binary
 * resolves node_modules statically, so every added dependency is a build that can only fail at
 * `bun run build:binary` — the same class of problem the `react-devtools-core` stub exists for. A
 * single-line field is a few lines of `useInput`; a dependency is not worth it.
 *
 * Both are drawn into a pane the cockpit hands them, beside the panes that say what is being acted
 * on, so they carry no framing and no title of their own. Every label arrives already localized;
 * nothing here knows a language.
