/**
 * preview.tsx — render the control center to plain stdout, at a size you choose.
 *
 * The control center only ever runs inside an alternate screen on a real tty, which makes it
 * exactly the kind of surface nobody can look at while building it: a screenshot needs a pty, and a
 * pty is not something a review, a diff or an agent has. This renders one frame through
 * `ink-testing-library` — no alternate screen, no raw mode, no host process — and prints it between
 * width rulers, so a row that overflows the terminal it was designed for is visible at a glance
 * instead of a bug report three days later.
 *
 *   bun run packages/tui/scripts/preview.tsx [--cols 100] [--rows 34]
 *                                            [--lang en|pt] [--screen services] [--mode solo|central|member]
 *
 * The host is a FAKE. It answers instantly, performs nothing, and is deliberately stocked with the
 * awkward cases rather than the happy one: a native server with a pid and an uptime, a service that
 * is down, a runtime whose state could not be detected at all, both runtimes of one service up at
 * once (the CONFLICT), a box with no repo checkout (so no rebuild is offered), and a member endpoint
 * long enough to have wrecked the header once already. `--mode` picks which arrangement you get.
 *
 * `--task` is the other half: it makes the fake host STREAM a realistic build into the output channel
 * — raw bytes, carriage returns and colour included, through the real decoder — so the pane a task
 * owns can be looked at both while it runs and once it has finished.
 *
 * The service rows themselves are built by the host's OWN `buildService` — the pure half of
 * `cli-start.ts` — rather than assembled here by hand. A preview that composed its own rows could
 * draw a screen the real model cannot produce, which is the one thing a preview must not do.
 *
 * This is a dev tool: it is not a test, it must not be collected as one, and nothing ships imports
 * it. Its only claim is "this is what the frame looks like".
