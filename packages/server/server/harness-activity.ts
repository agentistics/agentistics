 *
 *  `(?![\w-])` rather than the `\b` the original rule used: `\b` matches between `t` and `-`, so
 *  `git commit-tree` (plumbing, writes no commit) counted as one. Rare enough that no real total

 * wrong in the direction that matters: `echo git commit` and `# git commit is the next step` both
 * counted as commits, and the existing tests said so immediately. A counter that inflates on prose
 * is worse than one that misses a wrapper, because nothing on screen says which happened.
 *
 * Each entry is a program that RUNS another program. `npm`/`yarn`/`pnpm` are deliberately absent:
 * `npm run git commit` runs a script named `git`, not git.
