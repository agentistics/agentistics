/**
 * response-policy-composition.test.ts — pins that `handleRequest` in `index.ts` actually calls
 * `applyBaselineHeaders`, and that nothing AFTER that call undoes the framing headers it just set.
 *
 * `response-policy.test.ts` (if present) exercises `applyBaselineHeaders` itself — the function is
 * correct in isolation. Nothing pinned the WIRING: `index.ts` is ~4000 lines with a real `Bun.serve`
 * call at module top level (importing it directly would try to bind the product's own ports, which
 * this shared machine's real servers already hold — see `sdd/scratch/sessions/00-shared-rules.md`),
 * so a real request through the handler is not a safe or practical test here. A regression this
 * module's own header records as having shipped once — `if (k === 'X-Frame-Options') continue,
 * unconditional` inside a COPY of the header loop — passed the entire suite because every test
 * exercised the copy, not the real one; a `res.headers.delete('X-Frame-Options')` planted right
 * after the real call would pass just as silently were nothing reading the real source. This is a
 * stripped-source scan of `handleRequest`'s own body instead: comments are removed first
 * (`strip-comments.ts`), so a scan cannot pass on the prose above the function describing the very
 * call it is checking for.
