/**
 * cli-hooks.ts — `agentop hooks install | uninstall | status | context`.
 *
 * The I/O half of the Claude Code integration. Every DECISION it makes is already made by a pure
 * module: `claude-hooks.ts` says what goes in `settings.json` and how it merges, `claude-skill.ts`
 * says what the skill document is and whether the one on disk is ours, and `session-context.ts`
 * says what the hook prints. This file reads files, writes files, and reports.
 *
 * Three rules it exists to honour:
 *
 *  1. **Installing is something the user does.** Nothing here runs by itself. `agentop setup` may
 *     print one line suggesting the command; writing into someone's `~/.claude` because they
 *     installed a metrics dashboard is not a thing this project does. The precedent is
 *     `autostart.ts`, which touches `~/.bashrc` only behind an explicit `agentop autostart`.
 *  2. **The file is not ours.** Writes go through `planHookInstall` / `planHookRemoval`, which
 *     preserve every key they did not write and REFUSE a document they cannot merge into. On a
 *     refusal, nothing is written at all.
 *  3. **No Claude Code, no files.** If nothing here looks like a Claude Code install, the command
 *     says so and creates neither directory nor file — a `~/.claude` conjured by a dashboard is a
 *     directory the user did not ask for and will not know to delete.

  agentop hooks status

Teach Claude Code to run work in parallel through agentop, and to report when it stops.

  skill  ~/.claude/skills/${SKILL_NAME}/SKILL.md
         WHAT Claude needs to know: when a task splits into independent pieces, how to propose
         the split, how to write each session's prompt, and how to start them all with
         \`agentop session batch\`. Claude loads it when the task matches its description and
         ignores it otherwise, so it costs nothing on a session that never parallelises.

  hooks  two entries in ~/.claude/settings.json
         SessionStart → FACTS a static file cannot hold: which agentop sessions are running
         right now, which one is blocked on a permission prompt, which task can be reopened in
         this directory. It prints NOTHING when there is nothing running, so a quiet machine
         pays no tokens.
         Stop → records that this session finished a turn, into agentop's event inbox. It is
         the exact half of \`agentop events\`: Claude saying it stopped, rather than the fleet
         monitor inferring it from the screen five seconds later. It prints nothing at all.

A hook does not infer anything — it is a shell command on an event. The inference is Claude's,
reading what the skill teaches and what the hook injected. See docs/claude-integration.md.

Neither is installed unless you run this command, and \`uninstall\` takes back exactly what
\`install\` put there.`
