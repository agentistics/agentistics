// old shape has neither field — which `session-profile.ts`'s `n` reads as "no transcript was read
// for this session" rather than "read, and it compacted/invoked nothing". A closed conversation's
// transcript never changes again, so without this bump every session already in this cache would

 * comment above the branch that calls it says outright that this is MOST Claude sessions — and
 * before this bump it never computed either metric at all, so `compact_count`/`skill_uses` could
 * only ever be filled by `parseSessionJsonl` reading the raw transcript directly (the `'jsonl'`
 * source, the minority once a session ages into `session-meta`). Without the bump a row already
