/**
 * Map running processes to the sessions that are actually open.
 *
 * Two signals must agree, because each one alone produces wrong answers:
 *
 *   1. A running process of the session's own harness. Identity comes from the process itself
 *      whenever possible — the IDE extension launches `claude --resume=<id>`, and agy takes
 *      `--conversation <id>`. Ranking a project's sessions by recency instead (what this used to do)
 *      marked the wrong ones live: a session last touched days earlier was reported open while a
 *      genuinely resumed older session was only right by luck.
 *   2. Activity that POST-DATES the process. A live process is not proof on its own, not even when
 *      it names the session outright: reopening an editor restores its panels, so a `--resume`
 *      process routinely exists for a conversation nobody has touched in days. If the session has
 *      not been used once since its process started, that process is holding a restored-but-unused
 *      panel, not an open session. This bound is what a plain "active in the last N minutes" window
 *      cannot express — the window also throws away a session you really do have open and simply
 *      have not typed into for a while, which is why `windowMin` is only a far-out backstop.
 *
 * A process that never named a session (a fresh session, a bare `claude`, `agy` with no flags) is
 * still matched by harness + project. That fallback cannot claim a session already taken by an
 * exact id, and cannot claim one that went quiet before the process started.
 *
 * Pure — the process list and `nowMs` are the only external inputs.
