/**
 * spawn-web.ts — starting a session from the web dashboard, and reopening what fell.
 *
 * Everything here goes through the SAME host the terminal cockpit drives, so what the browser may
 * ask for is exactly what the wizard may ask for. Two consequences worth stating:
 *
 * - The harness list is `startableHarnesses()`, already narrowed by `availableHarnesses()` to the
 *   CLIs on PATH. A second list here would be the defect that fix exists to have removed once — a
 *   wizard offering `codex` where no codex exists starts a tmux session that dies on
 *   `command not found` behind a screen nobody is watching.
 * - `reopenFell` calls the host's own verb, which recomputes the crash group rather than trusting a
 *   snapshot. This spawns real assistants; a five-second-old list is the difference between
 *   reopening what fell and reopening what fell as of a moment ago.
 *
 * `attach` is never honoured from here. Attaching hands over a real terminal, which a browser tab
 * does not have — the request type does not even carry the flag, so it cannot be smuggled in.
