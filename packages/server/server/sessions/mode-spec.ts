/**
 * mode-spec.ts — PURE: the MODE a harness is in, and the key that changes it.
 *
 * Asked for: "nao consigo alternar entre os modos que os harnesses possuem (auto mode, plan mode
 * etc)". The terminal has always been able to — it is one keystroke — and the web had no way to
 * see the mode, let alone change it.
 *
 * THE MODE IS ON THE SCREEN, in the same footer `attention-rules.ts` reads for `working`, and it is
 * read the same way: the LAST FEW LINES ONLY (`FOOTER_LINES`), because a session whose transcript
 * quotes "plan mode on" would otherwise report itself as being in it. This module is developed with
 * this product, so that is a certainty rather than a risk.
 *
 * MEASURED, BY DRIVING A LIVE SESSION — claude 2.1.263, 2026-09-06. Sending `BTab` (tmux's name for
 * shift+tab) four times walked the whole cycle and came back to where it started:
 *
 *   ⏸ manual mode on · ? for shortcuts
 *   ⏵⏵ accept edits on (shift+tab to cycle)
 *   ⏸ plan mode on (shift+tab to cycle)
 *   ⏵⏵ auto mode on (shift+tab to cycle)
 *
 * Note that `manual` is the one whose footer does NOT say how to cycle — it advertises `? for
 * shortcuts` instead. Matching on "(shift+tab to cycle)" would therefore have found three of the
 * four and reported the fourth as unknown, which is why each mode is matched on its own NAME.
 *
 * IT CYCLES, IT DOES NOT PICK. There is no keystroke that jumps to a named mode, so offering a
 * menu of four would be a control that reaches three of them by luck. The verb is "next mode", the
 * row says which one it is now, and both are true.
 *
 * EVERY OTHER HARNESS IS `null`, and that is a finding rather than a gap: nobody has driven one to
 * see whether it has modes at all, what its footer says, or which key moves it. A guessed key sent
 * into a live assistant is a keystroke nobody asked for — the same reason `approval-spec.ts` refuses
 * a numbered dialog it has not probed.
