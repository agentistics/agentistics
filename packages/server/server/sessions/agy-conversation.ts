/**
 * agy-conversation.ts — PURE. Which conversation an antigravity process is writing, read off the
 * log agy keeps open for itself.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * `SpawnSpec.assignId` is how every other exact link is made, and agy has no such flag. Measured
 * 2026-09-08 against agy 1.1.27: `agy --conversation <fresh-uuid> -p "say ok"` answers
 * `warning: conversation "…" not found`, replies normally, and creates a conversation under an id
 * of its OWN — `--conversation` resumes and never assigns. So that route is closed.
 *
 * The fallback everything else leans on — find the conversation in the store by harness and
 * directory — is closed here too, and for a reason peculiar to agy: the adapter takes a
 * conversation's `project_path` from the GLOBAL `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/history.jsonl`, and agy
 * writes that file only for a prompt TYPED IN ITS UI. A session agentop starts is given its first
 * prompt as `--prompt-interactive`, so it never appears there and its store record carries
 * `project_path: ""`. Measured on this machine the same day: 15 of 38 agy conversations had a cwd,
 * and the 23 without were exactly the ones agentop had opened. A conversation with no cwd is
 * dropped by `loadConversations`, so `planFirstSightingClaims` never even sees it as a candidate —
 * which is why every agy session agentop starts was unlinkable BY CONSTRUCTION, and why its chat
 * view had nothing to read while the terminal worked perfectly.
 *
 * ## What replaces it, and why it is exact rather than another guess
 *
 * agy opens one log per process, `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/log/cli-<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.log`, and
 * HOLDS IT OPEN — verified in `/proc/<pid>/fd` of a live agy started under tmux. Into it it writes
 * one line per conversation it creates:
 *
 *     … 218 server.go:1153] Created conversation 39783297-b1b0-49bf-9f56-b809ee1933db
 *
 * So the chain is `managed row -> tmux pane pid -> open fd -> log -> conversation`, and every link
 * in it is a fact somebody can point at. Nothing is inferred from a directory, which is the
 * standing guess `session-view.ts`'s `metricsOf` refuses precisely because it gives every session
 * of one repository the same conversation.
 *
 * ## Read like the private file it is
 *
 * The format is undocumented and internal to agy; it can change shape in any release. So every
 * function here is TOTAL and answers `null` for anything it does not positively recognise — the
 * same discipline `antigravity-protobuf.ts` and `harness-session-file.ts` keep. An absent link
 * leaves the row exactly as it behaves today; a wrong one puts somebody else's conversation on
 * screen under this session's name, which the reader cannot detect and the user cannot either.
 *
 * ## The stated limit
 *
 * The fd is a `/proc` read, so this works on Linux and answers nothing anywhere else. That is a
 * degradation, not a lie: with no link the chat view says "this session has no linked conversation
 * yet" (`chat-web.ts`), which is true.

 * Which pids among the ones given cannot be trusted, because they share a log with another pid.

 * processes spawned together (2026-09-17), this is not merely an attribution question the way
 * `conversationFromAgyLog`'s "last wins" rule assumes (written for ONE process opening a SECOND
 * conversation of its own). Two DIFFERENT processes writing into one file is not "interleaved but
 * both present": of two processes that each completed a full turn, only ONE `Created conversation`
 * line survived in the shared file at all — the other's write was silently lost, not merely
 * reordered. So there is no line in such a file that can be safely attributed to either pid, and
 * every pid sharing that path must be refused — the mirror of `agyLogFromFds`'s existing "two
 * distinct logs on one process REFUSE", inverted: two processes on one log refuse.
 *
 * PURE: takes the log each pid already resolved to (`null` for a pid with no agy log open, which
 * never collides with anything), and answers which of them may NOT be trusted. A pid alone with
 * its log, or a pid with no log at all, is never in the answer.
