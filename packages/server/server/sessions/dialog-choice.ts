/**
 * dialog-choice.ts — PURE. The OPTIONS a blocked session is offering, read off its screen.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `approval-spec.ts` shipped with one keystroke per harness and the honest warning that it
 * "confirms the highlighted option and is not approve". That warning turns out to describe a real
 * hole rather than a caveat, and a user found it: a session sitting on
 *
 *     ❯ 1. Só o meu fix, isolado
 *       2. Promover dev→main inteiro
 *       3. Parar em dev por enquanto
 *       4. Type something.
 *
 * has no "approve". Pressing a key called approve there picks, blind, between four things that do
 * different work on somebody's repository. It is the same class of mistake as the prompt that fell
 * into a dialog's filter and approved a command nobody had read — quieter, and just as bad.
 *
 * The fix is not a better keystroke, it is READING THE OPTIONS and letting a person choose one.
 * They are on the screen; the frame is already captured to decide the state.
 *
 * ## Why the discriminator is the options and not the footer
 *
 * The obvious design is to tell "yes/no" dialogs from "choose one of N" by their footers, the way
 * `attention-rules.ts` tells one claude dialog from another. It does not survive contact with the
 * data: claude's PERMISSION prompt is itself a numbered list —
 *
 *     ❯ 1. Yes
 *       2. Yes, allow all edits during this session (shift+tab)
 *       3. No
 *
 * — so there is no yes/no dialog to separate out. There is one select component whose options
 * differ, and "Yes" being first is a convention, not a guarantee. The footer answers "is a dialog
 * open"; only the options answer "what would I be choosing".
 *
 * ## Confidence, and what happens without it
 *
 * A list of numbers is easy to hallucinate: an assistant that printed `1. foo / 2. bar` in its
 * answer would look exactly like a menu. Three things bound that:
 *
 *  - This is only ever run on a frame `attention-rules.ts` has ALREADY matched as a dialog.
 *  - The scan runs BOTTOM-UP and stops at the first `1.` it meets, so it reads the last block on
 *    the screen — the dialog is drawn at the bottom.
 *  - The numbers must come out as exactly `1..n` with nothing missing and nothing repeated. A
 *    prose list that happens to sit at the bottom will usually fail this; when it cannot be shown
 *    to be a menu, the answer is NO options, and the caller says so instead of guessing.
 *
 * Verified against three real claude 2.1.232 dialogs on 2026-08-14 (a Bash permission prompt, a
 * Write permission prompt and an `AskUserQuestion`), all captured from live sessions.

 *
 * THREE GLYPHS, not the two this shipped with. `❯` (U+276F) is claude's; codex draws its own
 * numbered menus (its directory-trust prompt, `1. Yes, continue` / `2. No, quit`) with `›`
 * (U+203A) instead — measured live, codex 0.153.4, 2026-09-10. Missing it meant the cursor's own

 * reached, and EVERY codex numbered dialog anchored on the row behind it and reported `unreadable`
 * / `no-anchor` instead of `options`. That is not a cosmetic miss: `no-anchor`'s `top` still points
 * at whatever WAS matched, which is what let `attentionOf`'s approval window widen over it anyway —

 * blocked — see `attention.test.ts`'s "a QUEUED message pushes the dialog footer off the bottom").
 * A STALE menu — the same numbered block still sitting on screen long after it was answered,
 * because the harness never scrolled it away — has a whole new turn below it instead: a header, a
 * reply, a fresh idle prompt. Measured on a real codex session (v0.153.4): 25 lines of genuine
 * post-dialog content sat below the very "1. Yes, continue / 2. No, quit" trust prompt it had
 * already answered, and the block was still being read as an open dialog. Every first-time codex
 * user hits this on their very first prompt — codex's own directory-trust dialog is exactly this
 * numbered block, it never scrolls out of `LAST_OPTION_LINES` on a short quiet reply, and reading
 * it as still-open makes `attentionOf` report `waiting-approval` forever, degrading chat mode down
 * to "attach to answer it there" for a session that has nothing left to answer.

 * The bound sits between the two measurements — comfortably above the legitimate 9, comfortably
