/**
 * fleet-web.ts — the WEB dashboard's window onto the session fleet.
 *
 * It owns no rules. The fleet is read through the very `ControlHost` the cockpit drives
 * (`createControlHost`), the rows are mapped by the very `toControlSession` the cockpit and
 * `agentop session ls` map with, and which verbs a row may take is the very `sessionActions` the
 * cockpit resolves every keypress against. What is added is the transport and nothing else.
 *
 * That indirection is the point rather than an accident. `answerSession` re-reads the frame
 * immediately before sending, re-parses the options, and REFUSES a numbered dialog on a harness
 * with no verified way to select by number — because the confirm key takes whichever row is
 * highlighted, which on "only my fix / promote everything / stop here" is choosing for somebody. A
 * browser-side copy of that would be a button that quietly picks. So the browser asks the host.
 *
 * The host is built ONCE per language and kept: constructing one fires a version check, and a fresh
 * host per request would fire one per poll.
