/**
 * gemini-chat.ts — PURE. Gemini's conversation, read from its own chat journal.
 *
 * ## Why this exists now and did not before
 *
 * `harness-transcript.ts` carried `gemini: null` with a reason, and the reason was a LINK fact
 * rather than a format one: a reader is only ever offered a `conversationId`, and gemini then had no
 * `assignId` and no id-taking `resume` (it has both since F0.2 — the header UUID is resolved by
 * `resolveGeminiTranscript` beside the synthetic id described below).
 *
 * What changed is that the link arrived from the other side. `planFirstSightingClaims` deliberately
 * includes gemini, and the id it claims is the SYNTHETIC one this product already keys the store on
 * — `${dirName}/${fileBase}` — which names a file directly:
 * `~/.gemini/tmp/<dirName>/chats/<fileBase>.jsonl`. So the id a gemini row now carries is not a
 * UUID that resolves to nothing; it is the path, in the only form this product ever knew it by.
 *
 * ## The journal, measured rather than assumed
 *
 * Captured 2026-09-08 from gemini 0.55.x. One JSON document per line:
 *
 *  - a HEADER — `{sessionId, projectHash, startTime, lastUpdated, kind}`;
 *  - a SEED — `{"$set":{"messages":[…]}}`, written once near the top and EMPTY for a fresh session
 *    (it repeats earlier turns for a resumed one);
 *  - the TURNS, appended each as their own top-level record
 *    `{id, timestamp, type, content, model?}`;
 *  - PATCHES — `{"$set":{"lastUpdated":…}}` after every turn, which are bookkeeping and not turns.
 *
 * The appended records are the part `gemini-parse.ts` was missing, and missing them is why 27 of
 * 34 chat files on this machine parsed to nothing at all. This module reads BOTH sources through
 * one `id`-keyed gate, because a resumed session carries the same turn in each.
 *
 * ## What is NOT a turn
 *
 * `info` and `error` are the harness talking about itself; they are dropped rather than attributed
 * to a speaker, the same way `antigravity-chat.ts` refuses to draw a `SYSTEM_MESSAGE` as a message.
 * And gemini writes a `<session_context>` bootstrap block under the USER role, which is not
 * something the person said — every other reader here applies the same rule to its own harness's
 * injected entry, and showing it would open every session on a wall of context nobody typed.
