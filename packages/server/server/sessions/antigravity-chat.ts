/**
 * antigravity-chat.ts — PURE: an Antigravity (agy) transcript's lines → `ChatTurn[]`.
 *
 * No fs, no side effects. `harness-transcript.ts` finds the file and hands the lines over.
 *
 * ON-DISK SHAPE, re-measured 2026-09-05 against the live conversation
 * `01d0814f-ef39-4838-8461-c50e540e552a` (agy 1.1.22, 2290 lines, appended to while it was read).
 * `antigravity-parse.ts` — the METRICS parser — already documents the envelope; what follows is the
 * part a CONVERSATION needs, which that parser never had to answer.
 *
 *   step_index  monotonic, unique in every file measured (0 duplicates in 2290)
 *   source      USER_EXPLICIT | MODEL | SYSTEM   — the honest role, and the only one
 *   type        USER_INPUT | PLANNER_RESPONSE | VIEW_FILE | RUN_COMMAND | GREP_SEARCH |
 *               CODE_ACTION | LIST_DIRECTORY | ERROR_MESSAGE | SYSTEM_MESSAGE | CHECKPOINT |
 *               CONVERSATION_HISTORY | GENERIC | …
 *   created_at  ISO with `Z`
 *   content     a STRING (never an object), absent on 1079 of the 2290 lines
 *   thinking    the model's reasoning, on a PLANNER_RESPONSE
 *   tool_calls  [{name, args}] — the REQUEST, and ONLY ever on a PLANNER_RESPONSE
 *   error / error_code / exit_code
 *
 * THE REQUEST AND THE EXECUTION ARE TWO STEPS, and this is the whole of the mapping.
 * A `PLANNER_RESPONSE` carries the model's prose, its thinking and the `tool_calls` it is asking
 * for — `{name: 'run_command', args: {CommandLine: 'agentop session kill 29bce', …}}`. The
 * execution then arrives as its OWN step (`RUN_COMMAND`, `VIEW_FILE`, …) whose `content` is the
 * result: for a command, the entire stdout. Measured: 1094 planner steps against 909 execution
 * steps, and the executions carry no `tool_calls` at all.
 *
 * So the conversation is built from the REQUESTS and the executions are dropped. This is the
 * inverse of the choice `harness-activity.ts` records for the same transcript ("Agy counts the
 * EXECUTION, never the request") and for the same reason — counting both is counting twice. A
 * COUNT wants the execution because that is the thing that happened; a CHAT BUBBLE wants the
 * request because that is the thing with the command in it, and the execution is pages of output
 * that `ChatTurn` has nowhere to put and a reader has no room for.
 *
 * WHAT NOBODY SAID IS NEVER DRAWN AS A MESSAGE. `USER_INPUT` is wrapped in `<USER_REQUEST>` with
 * an `<ADDITIONAL_METADATA>` block the harness appends (the local time); only the request is the
 * person's. `SYSTEM_MESSAGE`, `CHECKPOINT` and `ERROR_MESSAGE` are the harness talking and become
 * unattributed notes, exactly as `chat-envelope.ts` does for Claude's injected entries — and, like
 * those, a note NAMES the kind and never carries the body: agy's checkpoint summary is the whole
 * truncated conversation, and its error paragraph runs 206–633 characters (measured over all 77).
 *
 * `CONVERSATION_HISTORY` is a REPLAY of earlier turns and is skipped, the same rule
 * `antigravity-parse.ts` applies for the same reason: the turns it repeats are already in the file
 * as themselves, and reading both shows every one of them twice.

 * tool names, in a session that ran none of them. It was reported the moment it reached the screen,
