/**
 * shared-snapshot.ts — ONE POLLER, MANY READERS.
 *
 * Reported as "aqui na listagem aparecem 4 sessoes e no agentop so aparecem 3 … ambas deveriam
 * andar juntos". They cannot, as long as each surface polls for itself.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND POLLER DISAGREES, and it is not a race that can be tightened away: `working` is
 * MOVEMENT — the frame changed since the LAST poll of that poller — and `attention-confirm.ts`
 * additionally requires a state to be seen twice before it is believed. Both facts live in the
 * poller's own memory. A poller that has just started has neither, so it reads a producing session
 * as `waiting`, and a `running only` filter then hides it entirely. Measured at one instant on this
 * machine: the long-lived server reported all four sessions `working` while a freshly built host
 * reported the same four `waiting`. That is the four-versus-three.
 *
 * `agentop` runs as several processes — the server, the cockpit, every one-shot `agentop session
 * ls`, every `hooks context` — and four of them build their own poller today. The one that is
 * ALWAYS long-lived is `agentop server`. So the short-lived readers ask it, and fall back to
 * polling for themselves when nothing answers.
 *
 * THE FALLBACK IS NOT A DETAIL. The cockpit's whole purpose includes a machine whose server is
 * stopped — that is where you go to start it. So an unreachable server is an ordinary answer here
 * (`null`), never an error, and every caller keeps the poller it already had.
 *
 * The timeout is short on purpose: this sits in front of a local socket, and a reader that waits
 * seconds for a server that is not there is worse than one that polls for itself immediately.
