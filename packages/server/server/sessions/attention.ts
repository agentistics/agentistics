 *  - A probed `working` marker outranks the movement test, so a harness that thinks without
 *    redrawing is never mistaken for quiet.
 *  - Movement is tested two ways because each alone has a blind spot: tmux's `session_activity` has
 *    one-second resolution and moves when a spinner redraws identical bytes, while a frame digest
 *    cannot see a process that is busy and silent.
 *
 * `waiting` is the floor rather than an "unknown", and that is a deliberate claim: an interactive
 * assistant that is alive and still is waiting for its user. The uncertainty this system genuinely
 * has is about the REASON, and it lives in `attention-rules.ts` having no approval rule for a
 * harness nobody probed — which the UI states in words.
