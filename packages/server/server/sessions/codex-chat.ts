/**
 * codex-chat.ts — PURE: a Codex CLI rollout's lines → `ChatTurn[]`.
 *
 * No fs, no side effects. `harness-transcript.ts` finds the file and hands the lines over.
 *
 * ON-DISK SHAPE, measured 2026-09-05 over the 14 largest rollouts on this machine
 * (`~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<time>-<conversation-id>.jsonl`). `codex-parse.ts` — the
 * METRICS parser — documents the envelope; what follows is the part a CONVERSATION needs.
 *
 * Every line is `{timestamp, type, payload}` and the semantic type is at `payload.type`
 * (`codex-parse.ts` says the same). Counts over those 14 files:
 *
 *   response_item / message            81   (user 42, developer 19, assistant 20)
 *   response_item / function_call      23   the tool REQUEST — `{name, arguments}` (a JSON STRING)
 *   response_item / function_call_output 23 the result
 *   response_item / reasoning          17   `summary` + `encrypted_content`
 *   response_item / ghost_snapshot      3
 *   event_msg / user_message           21
 *   event_msg / agent_message          20
 *
 * EVERY MESSAGE IS WRITTEN TWICE, and picking the wrong copy loses half the conversation.
 * `event_msg/{user_message,agent_message}` and `response_item/message` carry the same text, adjacent
 * in the file and in an order that is not even consistent (the user's `response_item` precedes its
 * `event_msg`; the assistant's follows it). Reading both draws every turn twice, which is the trap
 * `kimi-parse.ts` records for its duplicated usage records and `harness-activity.ts` for agy's
 * request/execution pair.
 *
 * `response_item` is the copy that is read, for three reasons and not merely because it is bigger:
 *   1. The `event_msg` family is a strict SUBSET — 21 user events against 42 user messages. Eleven
 *      turns exist only as `response_item`, so that family cannot be the source at all.
 *   2. `function_call` and `reasoning` are already `response_item`s. Taking messages from the other
 *      family would mean reconciling two orderings to rebuild one conversation.
 *   3. It is the only copy that carries the harness's own injected material, which has to be
 *      CLASSIFIED rather than silently dropped — see below.
 *
 * WHAT NOBODY SAID IS NEVER DRAWN AS A MESSAGE. Same rule, same reason, as `chat-envelope.ts`'s for
 * Claude. Two things decide it here, and the ROLE is the stronger one:
 *   - `developer` is ALWAYS the harness. All 19 measured were tagged (`permissions` 12,
 *     `collaboration_mode` 4, `model_switch` 3) and none of them is a person speaking.
 *   - `user` is the person UNLESS an envelope says otherwise: `<environment_context>` (7) and
 *     `<turn_aborted>` (1) are the harness, while `<user_shell_command>` (2) IS the person — they
 *     ran a command — and is UNWRAPPED to what they ran, exactly as `chat-envelope.ts` unwraps
 *     Claude's `<bash-input>`. 32 of the 42 carried no tag at all and are simply theirs.
 *   - An UNRECOGNISED tag is left as the person's. That is the safe direction and the one
 *     `chat-envelope.ts` argues for: a message that merely starts with `<` (a diff, a snippet) is
 *     real, and hiding it is the expensive mistake.
 *
 * THINKING EXISTS, SOMETIMES, AND IS NEVER THE ENCRYPTED FIELD. A `reasoning` item carries
 * `encrypted_content` (17 of 17) and a `summary` that is readable on only 5 of them. The summary is
 * used when it is there and the item contributes nothing when it is not — an absent thought is
 * absent, and `encrypted_content` is not one this or any reader can show.
