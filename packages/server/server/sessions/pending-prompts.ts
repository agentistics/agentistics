/**
 * pending-prompts.ts — a message handed to a session and not yet visible in its transcript.
 *
 * Reported: "quando eu envio uma mensagem pelo celular a mensagem não aparece em todos os
 * dispositivos… diferentes dispositivos, mesmo acessando a mesma aplicação, não estão
 * sincronizados". And then the worse half: "se eu fechar a aplicação e abrir de novo a mensagem
 * vira um fantasma e não dá pra saber se foi perdida ou está em fila".
 *
 * Both come from the same place. The queued message was a BROWSER fact — an echo held in the tab
 * that sent it — so a second device had no way to learn about it, and the tab that did know lost
 * the one thing that made it readable on a reload: when it was sent. A message you cannot tell
 * apart from a lost one is worse than either.
 *
 * So the queue moves to the server, which is the only party every device already agrees with. Two
 * consequences, and both are the point:
 *
 *  - **every device shows it**, because they all poll the same list;
 *  - **it carries `at`**, so any of them can say how long it has been waiting instead of showing a
 *    bubble with no age.
 *
 * IT IS IN MEMORY, DELIBERATELY. This is state about a message in flight, and the durable record of
 * whether it arrived is the transcript itself. A server restart drops the queue, which is honest:
 * afterwards the transcript either carries the message or it does not, and nothing here is claiming
 * otherwise. Persisting it would create the one thing this file exists to remove — an entry that
 * outlives the truth and cannot be told apart from it.
 *
 * RETIRING IS `pendingEchoes`, from `@agentistics/core`, which is where that rule now lives BECAUSE
 * of this file. The browser has always had it; a second implementation here would be a second
 * opinion about whether a message has landed, on the same screen, in the same second.

 * them. Twenty minutes is far longer than any real queue here and far short of a session's life.
