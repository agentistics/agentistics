/**
 * attention-rules.ts — PURE. The per-harness screen markers, READ FROM REAL FRAMES.
 *
 * Every pattern here was captured on 2026-08-13 by starting the CLI under tmux and reading
 * `capture-pane -p`. Nothing is written from memory of what a CLI prints, for the same reason
 * `spawn-spec.ts` reads every flag from the tool's own `--help`: a plausible-looking pattern that
 * never matches fails SILENTLY. It does not throw and it does not look wrong — it just reports a
 * working session as waiting, forever, and the counter that was supposed to earn this feature its
 * place becomes noise.
 *
 * Two findings from that probe are load-bearing, and both contradict what the patterns would have
 * been if guessed:
 *
 *  - **Claude's input box is not a discriminator.** The `❯` prompt line and its two rules are drawn
 *    identically while a turn is running and after it finishes. Only the FOOTER changes —
 *    `esc to interrupt` while working, `? for shortcuts` when done. A rule keyed on the box would
 *    have called every working session waiting.
 *  - **Codex has no working marker at all.** Its status footer and its ghost placeholder
 *    (`› Find and fix a bug in @filename`) are byte-identical while it streams output and while it
 *    sits idle. For codex, movement is the only working signal that exists, so `working` is absent
 *    rather than approximated.
 *
 * `Record<HarnessId, … | null>` and not a `Partial`: a harness added to `HarnessId` must fail the
 * build until someone decides, exactly as `SPAWN_SPECS` and `HARNESS_CAPABILITIES` do. `null` is
 * that decision — "not probed", which the UI reports as approval detection being unavailable.
 *
 * No pattern may carry the `g` flag: `RegExp.test` is stateful with it and alternate calls return
 * false. The test asserts this.

      // then typed into it went into the dialog's own filter — where the submit selected the

      // footer rather than one dialog's wording — the same standard the gemini entry below holds

      //   Bash   `Esc to cancel · Tab to amend · ctrl+e to explain`
      //   Write  `Esc to cancel · Tab to amend`
      // The shared part is what is matched. `ctrl+e to explain` is offered only where there is a
      // command to explain, so keying on it would have missed every file edit.

      // `↑/↓ to navigate` never appears in the order the line above expects. So on a current
      // claude none of the three rules above match anything, and a session sitting on a question
      // read as plain `waiting`: no approval card in the web chat, no refusal when a prompt was
      // sent into it. Reported with the terminal open beside the browser — an `AskUserQuestion`

      // part that names the COMPONENT — `Esc to cancel` alone is shared with dialogs that are not
      // questions, and `Enter to select` alone appears in pickers that are not blocking.

      // never opens (measured: two commands that should have asked, neither did). It is left
      // UNGUESSED rather than approximated from strings in the binary: a wrong approval pattern is
