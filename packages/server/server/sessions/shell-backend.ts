 * `reconcileShells`.
 *
 * Everything runs on `SHELL_SOCKET`, never the fleet's. That is structural and not a naming
 * convention: on the fleet socket `parseTmuxList` would keep these sessions and `reconcileSessions`
 * would report each as an `unregistered` fleet row. See `tmux-cli.ts`'s note on `SHELL_SOCKET`.
