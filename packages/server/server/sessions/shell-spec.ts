/**
 * shell-spec.ts — PURE. What opening a utility shell decides, and every way it refuses.
 *
 * The shell is a PTY in the session's own directory, opened for the person, and it is the most
 * powerful thing this server can be asked for. So every decision that can be silently wrong lives
 * here and is tested without a tmux server: which binary, which directory, and which of the four
 * refusals applies.
 *
 * A REFUSAL IS A CODE, NEVER A SENTENCE. The route renders it, so this module stays language-free —
 * the same split `central-runtime.ts` makes with its reason codes and `LiveUnavailableReason` makes
 * with its own.
 */

/**
 * How many utility shells one machine may hold at once.
 *
 * A CEILING AND NOT A TIMER, and the number lives here alone. A TTL would kill the `bun test` that
 * finished at minute 61 and whose output the person wanted, at an hour nobody was watching, and it
 * needs a timer running for the life of the process. A ceiling needs nothing running: it is one
 * check, on open, and it only ever closes something at the instant somebody is asking for a new
 * one — so the trade is visible at the moment it is made.
