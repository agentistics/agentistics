/**
 * approval-spec.ts — PURE. The keystroke that ANSWERS each harness's blocking dialog.
 *
 * A sibling of `attention-rules.ts`, and deliberately a second file rather than a field on it,
 * because the two answer different questions and can be known independently: `attention-rules.ts`
 * says how to RECOGNISE that a session is blocked, this says what to SEND once it is. A harness
 * could be probed for the first and not the second — a dialog whose footer names no key at all — and
 * a single record would then force one guess to stand in for the other.
 *
 * ## What a spec claims, exactly
 *
 * `key` is the keystroke that CONFIRMS THE OPTION THE DIALOG HAS HIGHLIGHTED. It is not "approve",
 * and the difference matters enough to be the reason this feature is built the way it is: none of
 * these CLIs can be asked which option is highlighted, and a dialog whose default is "No, tell
 * Claude what to do differently" would be answered by the same byte that approves everywhere else.
 *
 * So the keystroke is only half of the design. The other half is that the caller REREADS the screen
 * immediately before sending (a poll is up to five seconds old — the dialog may already be gone) and
 * SHOWS THE FRAME to the person answering. What is being confirmed is on the screen; the only thing
 * this table supplies is the byte that presses it.
 *
 * ## Where the values come from
 *
 * Every one of them is the footer `attention-rules.ts` captured, read for what it says about keys —
 * same probe, same CLI versions, same date, nothing added from memory of what a CLI prints:
 *
 *   claude       `Enter to confirm · Esc to cancel`
 *   codex        `Press enter to continue`
 *   kimi         `↑↓ navigate · Enter select · Esc exit`
 *   gemini       `Enter to select · ↑/↓ to navigate`
 *   copilot      `↑/↓ to navigate · enter to select`
 *   antigravity  `↑/↓ Navigate · enter Confirm`
 *
 * All six name ENTER, and all six name it as the key that takes the highlighted option. That the
 * table currently holds one value six times is a finding, not a shortcut — the footers disagree
 * about wording, capitalisation and whether `esc` is even mentioned, which is exactly why each is
 * recorded on its own row rather than collapsed into one shared assumption.
 *
 * `Record<HarnessId, … | null>` and not a `Partial`: a harness added to `HarnessId` must fail the
 * build until someone decides, the same rule `SPAWN_SPECS`, `ATTENTION_RULES` and
 * `HARNESS_CAPABILITIES` follow. `null` is that decision — "nobody has read this dialog" — and the
 * verb is then ABSENT rather than offered and wrong, with the UI saying so in words.
 *
 * The values are tmux key names (`send-keys` argument syntax), because that is the only backend
 * there is. When a second backend exists this becomes its own vocabulary; until then, inventing an
 * abstraction over one implementation would be inventing a mapping nobody can check.

   *
   * MEASURED on claude 2.1.x under tmux on 2026-09-08, on the harness's own select component (the
   * `/model` picker, which draws the same widget): `Down` moved the `❯` from row 2 to row 3, two
   * `Up`s walked it back to row 1, and `Escape` closed the dialog. The trust prompt itself was NOT
   * driven — it does not reappear on a machine that has already trusted its folders, and neither

   * MEASURED 2026-09-08 by driving a live `kimi` 0.41.0 in a fresh directory: its trust prompt is
   * numberless too, and each option carries a DESCRIPTION line at the SAME indentation, with blank

   * How the SCREEN says a free-text field is open and taking keys.

   * WHY IT CANNOT BE INFERRED FROM THE OPTION LIST. The check that shipped read the list: a field
   * that opened was assumed to REPLACE the options, so a list still parsing the same way meant the
   * digit had merely moved the highlight. Measured against claude 2.1.263 on 2026-09-08, that is
   * false — the field opens IN PLACE, the row keeps its `Type something.` label until something is
   * typed into it, and every other option stays exactly where it was. So the guard read a field
   * that HAD opened as one that had not, and refused a perfectly good answer in words that named
   * the opposite of what happened. Reported as the option's number being fired instead of letting
   * you type.
   *
   * The footer is the honest signal. `ctrl+g to edit in VS Code` is an affordance only a TEXT FIELD
   * has, and it tracks the field rather than the dialog: driving a live session, it appeared the
   * moment the digit landed on `Type something.` and disappeared the moment an arrow moved the
   * highlight off it. Matched in the footer only, like every other rule here — this product is
   * developed with this product, and a transcript quoting the hint is a certainty.
   *
   * ABSENT means nobody has probed it. A caller must then treat "did the field open" as unknowable
   * from the frame and fall back to whatever positive evidence it has, never to a guess.
