/**
 * task-stats.ts — PURE. What a delivery looked like, beyond what it cost.
 *
 * `task-rollup.ts` answers the three headline questions (cost, rounds, sessions). This answers the
 * ones asked next: which models did the work, which harnesses, how many agents ran, and how long
 * the thing actually took in hours and days.
 *
 * The same rule governs all of it: **a distribution counts only what a session actually reported**.
 * A harness that records no model contributes no model row rather than an `unknown` bar, and a
 * delivery that has not been delivered has no duration rather than a duration up to now — "still
 * running" and "took N hours" are different sentences.

/**
 * `taskStats`, scoped to ONE piece of the delivery — a subtask, or the "direct" branch
 * (`subtaskId: null`, the rows filed on the task itself, under no subtask). This is the same
 * partition `subtaskViews` (`task-report.ts`) already applies to the ROLLUP, extended to this
 * block: files/errors/lines/tokens/commits/models/harnesses computed over only the rows filed
 * under this one piece, never over the whole task's rows.
 *
 * `rows` is expected already scoped to the task (`rowsOfTask(task, allRows)`), exactly like
 * `subtaskViews`'s own `rows` parameter — this never re-derives that scope. Every row of a task
 * falls into EXACTLY one bucket across the full set of calls (one per subtask, plus `null` for the
 * direct branch), so summing every bucket's numeric fields reproduces `taskStats` computed once
 * over the task's whole row set — the same guarantee `subtaskViews`'s three-shapes test pins for
 * the cost/session rollup, checked here for the evidence numbers instead.
 *
 * A caller — e.g. `SessionTasksTab.tsx`'s subtask-scoped panel — uses the `null` return (see
 * `scopedTaskStats` above) to render "nothing filed here yet" instead of a stats block full of
 * dashes.
 *
 * **Ungrouped only.** This filters by a single `subtaskId` and is exactly right for the direct
 * branch and for a subtask with no `groupId`. A GROUPED subtask's bucket is the union of every
 * member's rows and is computed in `subtaskViews` itself via `scopedTaskStats`, never here — a
 * caller asking this function for one member's id alone would see only that member's rows, not the
 * group's, disagreeing with the rollup it sits beside.
 *
 * `createdAt`/`deliveredAt` are passed straight through to `taskStats` and are NOT re-derived from
 * the subtask's own dates — `Subtask` carries no `deliveredAt` field today, so what a subtask's own
 * "delivery" wall time should mean is left to the caller to decide (and is out of scope for this
 * function, which only re-partitions the evidence numbers `taskStats` already computes).
