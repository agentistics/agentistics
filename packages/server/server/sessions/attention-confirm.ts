/**
 * attention-confirm.ts — PURE. Turns the fleet's INSTANTANEOUS per-poll reading into a CONFIRMED
 * one, so the "needs you" counter stops lying.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists for
 *
 * `attention.ts` answers "what is this session doing" from a SINGLE frame, and it is right to: for
 * the several harnesses whose only working signal is movement, "the screen moved, so it is working"
 * is the only rule there is. But a single frame is a noisy sample. A session that has just finished
 * a turn, or one whose pane a plugin repainted for a moment, reads `working` on one poll and
 * `waiting` on the next with nothing about the session having changed — and a coordinator operating
 * a fleet reported being sent to a session as "waiting on you" that had already gone back to work.
 * The written rule in that workspace became "do not trust the activity field; read the pane with
 * `tmux capture-pane`" — which is exactly the manual work the monitor exists to remove.
 *
 * ## The asymmetry that shapes the rule
 *
 * Getting these two states wrong does NOT cost the same. Saying "working" about a session that has
 * stopped merely delays a person by one poll. Saying "needs you" about a session that is moving
 * WASTES the person — the most expensive resource here — and, worse, corrodes trust in the
 * indicator; once it has cried wolf, it stops being read, and that cost is permanent. So the two
 * directions are confirmed differently:
 *
 *  - **Returning to work (`working`) and exiting (`exited`) are believed at once.** A screen that
 *    moved is unambiguous proof, and clearing attention eagerly is the cheap error — a person is
 *    never sent to a session that has already resumed. This also makes the counter DROP on the very
 *    next sample after work resumes, which is the behaviour a person watching the fleet expects.
 *  - **`waiting` and `waiting-approval` — the states that summon a person — are believed only once
 *    the same reading has been seen on TWO CONSECUTIVE polls.** A one-frame quiet or a cosmetic
 *    repaint never reaches the counter; genuine attention holds the screen for longer than one
 *    interval and is confirmed on the following poll (one interval of latency, the cheap direction).
 *
 * ## Relationship to `event-plan.ts`
 *
 * The event channel confirms EVERY transition on two polls (`planEvents`), because a duplicate
 * notification is the failure IT is judged on. This module confirms only the needs-you direction and
 * clears eagerly, because a stale "needs you" on a live dashboard is the failure THIS surface is
 * judged on. The two therefore AGREE on the reported harm — neither raises `waiting` from a single
 * frame — and diverge only on how fast they clear it, by design: the fleet display drops attention a
 * poll sooner than the notification stream, which is the right way round for each.
 *
 * Pure, and total: it reads a memory + one poll's raw readings and returns the confirmed readings
 * plus the memory for the next poll. The poller (`sessions-host.ts`) carries the memory and feeds
 * the confirmed map to `buildSessionViews`, so the count, the sort, the bell and the TUI all read
 * the confirmed state without knowing this step happened.

   * The sessions whose reading is CORROBORATED — believe them at once.
   *
   * The asymmetry below (work resumed is believed immediately, needing a person is confirmed) was
   * right about the direction and wrong about the evidence. `attentionOf` reads `working` from
   * whether the pane MOVED, and a pane moves for reasons that are not a turn: a repaint, an
   * advisory line, a plugin notice. Each of those flipped a row to `working` for one poll and back,
   * so the row changed colour and wording continuously and a notification went out each time —
   * reported as exactly that.
   *
   * So `working` keeps its immediacy only where something CORROBORATES it: the harness's own
   * working marker on screen (`esc to interrupt`). A harness that prints no marker has nothing
   * better than movement and must keep believing it at once, or codex would never read as working
   * at all — which is why this is a set the CALLER fills, not a rule this module can decide.
