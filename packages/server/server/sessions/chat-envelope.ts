/**
 * chat-envelope.ts — PURE: is a `type: 'user'` transcript entry something the PERSON said?
 *
 * Claude Code writes several kinds of entry under the `user` role that no person typed. They are
 * the harness talking to itself in the one channel the transcript has for input: a background task
 * reporting back, a hook's output, a reminder injected before a turn, the stdout of a `!` command.
 * `isHumanUserEntry` (jsonl.ts) does not separate them — it only excludes a pure `tool_result` —
 * so the chat pane rendered every one of them in the user's own bubble, over their avatar.
 *
 * Reported by the user, who circled a `<task-notification>` block and said "I didn't send that
 * message." They were right, and it is the same class of defect as `sessionLabel()` stripping
 * `<local-command-caveat>` out of a title: the transcript's raw text is a wire format, and putting
 * it on screen attributes the harness's plumbing to a human being.
 *
 * MEASURED on this machine, over the 40 most recently touched transcripts — 715 user entries
 * carrying text, of which 116 (16%) were an envelope:
 *
 *   54  <task-notification>      a background task finished        SYSTEM
 *   24  <system-reminder>        injected context for the turn     SYSTEM
 *   11  <local-command-caveat>   "the messages below were…"        SYSTEM
 *   11  <command-name>           a slash command the user ran      PERSON (unwrapped)
 *    5  <local-command-stdout>   that command's output             SYSTEM
 *    5  <bash-input>             a `!` line the user ran           PERSON (unwrapped)
 *    5  <bash-stdout>            that line's output                SYSTEM
 *    1  <command-message>        the slash command's own text      PERSON (unwrapped)
 *
 * The split is not cosmetic. `<command-name>` and `<bash-input>` ARE the person acting — dropping
 * them would erase a turn that happened — so they are UNWRAPPED to the thing they typed (`/foo`,
 * `!ls`) rather than shown as XML or hidden. Everything else is the harness, and is reported as a
 * one-line note naming WHAT it was, never its body: a `<system-reminder>` can be the whole of
 * CLAUDE.md, and a pane that renders it has stopped being a conversation.
 *
 * The list is a matched pair with the measurement above and nothing more — an envelope nobody has
 * seen is not in it. An UNRECOGNISED entry is therefore treated as the person's, which is the safe
 * direction: a real message wrongly hidden is gone, while a new envelope wrongly shown is the
 * behaviour that already shipped.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * THE TAG TABLE IS ONLY HALF OF IT, and the other half is a flag the harness sets itself.
 * Re-measured 2026-09-04 over the 120 most recently touched transcripts — 992 `user` entries
 * carrying text:
 *
 *   800  isMeta ABSENT   the person
 *   192  isMeta true     the harness, and 148 of those carry NO envelope tag at all
 *     0  isMeta false    never written
 *
 * Those 148 went into the person's own bubble, because the table above decides by LEADING TAG and
 * they have none. By first line:
 *
 *    52  Another Claude session sent a message:
 *    31  [Image: …]                          (`source: <path>`, and `original WxH…`)
 *    21  Continue from where you left off.
 *    13  Base directory for this skill: /…   ← the block the user circled, a whole SKILL.md
 *     6  The coordinator sent a message while you were working…
 *     2  ## Context Usage
 *     2  a `/config` output
 *
 * So `classifyUserEntry` checks the FLAG FIRST — it is the harness declaring the entry is not a
 * turn the person took — and the tag table keeps doing the job the flag cannot: unwrapping
 * `<command-name>` and `<bash-input>` to the thing the person actually typed. Those ARE the person
 * acting, and dropping them would erase a turn that happened.
 *
 * Note the shape: a person's entry does not carry `isMeta: false`, it carries no `isMeta` key. The
 * test keys on `=== true` so that both an absent flag and an explicit `false` read as the person —
 * the direction that has to be safe.
