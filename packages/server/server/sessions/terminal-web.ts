/**
 * terminal-web.ts — the WEB dashboard's live terminal channel onto one session's pane.
 *
 * The sibling of `fleet-web.ts`, and deliberately LEANER than it. `fleet-web` routes through the
 * Ink control host because the fleet's ACTIONS carry rules that must not be re-implemented in a
 * browser (a numbered dialog is never answered by a bare confirm). Reading a screen carries no such
 * rule — a capture is a capture — so this channel talks straight to the session backend and skips
 * the React/Ink import graph entirely. It keeps exactly ONE rule of its own, the one that matters:
 * SCOPE. A stream is opened only for a session THIS MACHINE MANAGES (its own registry), so the read
 * power never reaches past the fleet the dashboard already lists — the same boundary the write path
 * will inherit in Phase 2, established here where it is cheap.
 *
 * The heavy lifting (shared loop, dedup, death) is `terminal-hub.ts`; the framing is the pure
 * `terminal-stream.ts`. This file is just the singleton wiring and the SSE plumbing. The whole
 * surface is additionally gated by `localShell` in `capability-guard.ts` and 404'd on a central, so
 * it is unreachable on an internet-exposed instance regardless of who is authenticated — a captured
 * terminal is shell access with extra steps.
