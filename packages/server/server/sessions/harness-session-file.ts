/**
 * harness-session-file.ts — PURE. What a harness records ABOUT ITS OWN SESSION, and which name wins.
 *
 * Claude Code writes `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` while a session is alive. It holds the name the
 * user gave it with `/rename`, the conversation id, the pid, and — for a session started under our
 * backend — the tmux session name. That last field is the interesting one: it is an EXACT link from
 * a harness's own record to an agentop row, where everything else in this codebase has had to guess
 * by harness-and-directory.
 *
 * ## This is one harness's private file, so it is read like one
 *
 * The format is undocumented and internal to Claude Code; it can change shape in any release. So:
 * every field is checked, a missing or wrong-typed one yields "I do not know" rather than a throw or
 * an invented value, and a file that will not parse is simply absent. Same discipline as
 * `antigravity-protobuf.ts`, which never throws.
 *
 * `Record<HarnessId, … | null>` for the same reason `SPAWN_SPECS` is one: the other five harnesses
 * have no such file, or have one in a shape nobody has read, and they must go on behaving exactly as
 * they do today rather than being handed a guess.
 *
 * ## Which name wins, and why it is not the obvious answer
 *
 * `nameSource: 'derived'` marks a name CLAUDE INVENTED (`agentistics-77`, `aipe-c9`) rather than one
 * a person typed. Measured on this machine: 24 of 40 named session files are derived. A derived name
 * is not a name, and letting one replace a label somebody chose in agentop would be the "reopen
 * renamed the row back to the transcript's title" bug wearing a new hat. It is dropped before
 * anything else is considered.
 *
 * `nameSince` would settle the rest by recency, and it is the field this cannot lean on: it appears
 * only in claude 2.1.232 (3 of 16 user-named files here; every older version writes the name with no
 * timestamp at all). So the rule has to work when the comparison is impossible, and `pickTitle`
 * spells out what it does in each case rather than pretending the timestamps are there.
 *
 * When the two names disagree, NEITHER is thrown away: the winner becomes the title, the loser stays
 * on the row's facts, and `source` says which is which. Someone who renamed in both places must be
 * able to see that both renames happened — otherwise the one that lost reads as a rename that
 * silently failed.
