/**
 * shell-input-web.ts — the utility shell's WRITE channel, `WS /api/shell/input?id=<shellId>`.
 *
 * The write-side sibling of `shell-stream-web.ts`, and the shell-scoped twin of `input-web.ts`.
 * Same shape as the fleet's: the ORDER guarantee and the per-message confirmation are the pure
 * `input-channel.ts`, the wire contract is the pure `input-protocol.ts`, and this file is only the
 * socket plumbing. So a browser typing into a shell speaks EXACTLY the protocol it speaks to a
 * session, and the client needs one implementation rather than two.
 *
 * What is not shared is the scope: `input-web.ts` resolves an id against `managed-sessions.json`,
 * and this one against `shells.json`. Reusing it would have handed a shell id the fleet's answer.
 *
 * Everything harder is upstream, in `index.ts`, and it is the same gate the open route rides:
 * `localShell` (capability-guard), the user's own `shellEnabled` switch,
 * and — for the upgrade specifically — the same-origin check (CSWSH). A raw shell is the most
 * powerful thing this server does, so it rides the very same gates as the fleet channel and no
 * lower ones.
