/**
 * Collapse a session's RETIRED predecessors against its own continuation — PURE, and keyed on the

 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A session's durable identity is its CONVERSATION, but the registry keys a record by the per-spawn
 * `managedId`. Every attach / reopen / restart mints a NEW managedId for the SAME conversation and
 * retires the old record (`endedAt`) without removing it — so `reconcileSessions` returns one record
 * per spawn and `buildSessionViews` draws one row per record. A conversation reopened five times
 * therefore stood on screen as five `exited` rows beside its one live continuation, all wearing the
 * same name. Measured here: 18 conversations held more than one record, 36 rows of pure history that
 * a person reads as "this session is open many times over".
 *
 * ## What it may and may NOT drop — the guarantee
 *
 * The coordinator reads this list to decide whether to re-dispatch over work in flight, so a row it
 * cannot prove is dead is NEVER hidden. A row is dropped only when BOTH hold:
 *
 *  1. it is PROVABLY dead — `endedMs` is set, which means the system retired or the user finished it;
 *     a `lost` row with no end time (a reboot, say) is never touched, because "the backend cannot see
 *     it right now" is not proof the process is gone; and
 *  2. it is SUPERSEDED — the same conversation has either a LIVE row (running / unregistered) or a
 *     strictly newer ended row. That sibling IS this session, continued, so the predecessor is its
 *     own history, not a second session.
 *
 * Consequences, each deliberate:
 *  - a LIVE row is never dropped (it has no `endedMs`);
 *  - the newest ended row of a conversation with nothing live is KEPT — it is the reopenable
 *    representative, and a finished session the user wants back must still be there;
 *  - rows with NO `conversationId` are never grouped and never collapsed: two sessions that merely
 *    share a directory or a label are genuinely distinct, and the list telling the truth about them
 *    is the whole point — the fix is identity, never appearance.
 *
 * Two rows with the SAME `conversationId` cannot be distinct sessions: it is the harness's own id for
 * one conversation. So this never merges two real sessions — only a session with its own past lives.

  // This was harness-and-directory alone, so a session that CHANGED DIRECTORY stopped matching the
  // row hosting it and was drawn a second time as `external`. Measured on this machine: one claude,
  // started by agentop in the repo root, entered a worktree — its kernel cwd moved to
  // `.claude/worktrees/token-truth` while the managed row kept the directory it was spawned in, and
  // the fleet showed one conversation twice, `working` on the row and `external` beside it. Its own
  // record read `"cwd":"…/worktrees/token-truth","tmux":"agentop-e3e4fc2ce6"` — naming the very row
  // it was being listed apart from. Any `cd`, `/add-dir` or worktree reproduces it, and the
  // duplicate is not cosmetic: the external twin offers REOPEN, which would put a second assistant
  // on one transcript.
  //
  // So the EXACT link is asked first. `identifiesManagedRow` reads the tmux session the harness
  // wrote about ITSELF — `agentop-<our id>` for a session we started — which is a fact the process
  // stated, immune to whatever it does with its working directory afterwards. `status` is
  // deliberately not consulted on that path: the link is proof that this process IS that row, and a
  // row reconciled to `lost` while its process is demonstrably alive is a reconciliation fault to
  // be shown as one, never a licence to draw the session twice.
  //
  // The directory guess still answers everything the link cannot — another harness, a tmux session
  // that is not ours, a claude too old to write the field. There:
  //  - a row whose harness is unknown covers NOTHING: it might be that process or might not, and
  //    silently swallowing an external session on a maybe is the worse of the two errors — a
  //    duplicate row is visible and self-correcting, a missing one is not;
  //  - only a row that is actually RUNNING can account for a running process. `!== 'lost'` was too
  //    wide: an `exited` row accounts for a process that is GONE, and letting it cover swallows a
  //    live session that happens to share its directory. Measured — three exited rows sat in the
  //    worktree of a background agent that was alive, and the agent was hidden behind them and
  //    listed as a closed conversation instead.
