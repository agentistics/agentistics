/**
 * input-web.ts — the WEB dashboard's WRITE channel onto one session's pane, over a WebSocket.
 *
 * The write-side sibling of `terminal-web.ts` (the read SSE stream). Same two-layer shape: the
 * ORDER guarantee and the per-message confirmation are the pure `input-channel.ts`; the contract is
 * the pure `input-protocol.ts`; this file is only the singleton wiring and the socket plumbing.
 *
 * It keeps the same ONE rule the read channel keeps — SCOPE. A socket is opened only for a session
 * THIS MACHINE MANAGES (its own registry), so the write power never reaches past the fleet the
 * dashboard already lists. Everything harder is upstream of it: `index.ts` refuses the upgrade unless
 * `localShell` is granted (capability-guard) and the Origin is same-origin (CSWSH), and 404s it on a
 * central. A captured terminal is shell access with extra steps; typing into one is the shell itself,
 * so it rides the very same gates, and no lower ones.
 *
 * The backend is resolved LAZILY via a dynamic import, exactly as `terminal-web.ts` reaches it
 * dynamically: it keeps this module's own static graph light (registry + the two pure input modules),
 * so `index.ts` can name these handlers without pulling the session-view/Ink graph into the server
 * that never opens this page.
