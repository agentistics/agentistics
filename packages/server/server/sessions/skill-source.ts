 * are read from the `SkillSource` this harness already declares rather than re-derived here — the
 * plugin shape (`<root>/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/skills/<name>`, invoked `<plugin>:<name>`)
 * is stated once, in `HARNESS_SKILLS`, and two readers now depend on that one statement.
 *
 * A directory matching NO declared source answers `null` rather than falling back to its basename.
 * A basename would look like an answer and resolve to no row in the panel, which is the confident
 * wrong value this codebase refuses everywhere else — the caller then simply omits the reference
