 * answer to "what can this row take", and the cockpit resolves every keypress against it; this
 * module calls it and carries the result over the wire. A browser-side re-derivation would be a
 * second set of rules — the bug `task-reopen.ts` exists to have fixed once — and it would go wrong
 * in the one direction that costs work: offering `approve` on a numbered dialog belonging to a
 * harness with no verified way to pick, where the keystroke takes whichever row is highlighted.
 *
 * What IS decided here is narrower and belongs to the browser: which of those verbs a PAGE can
 * perform at all. `attach` hands a real terminal to a session and a browser has none, so the row
 * carries the command that does it instead of a button that cannot.
