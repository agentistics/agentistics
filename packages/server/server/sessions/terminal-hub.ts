/**
 * terminal-hub.ts — one capture loop per WATCHED session, shared by every reader of it.
 *
 * The criterion the spec sets is "follow the agent without hammering the server with a fleet of open
 * sessions". Two properties deliver it, and both live here:
 *
 *  - **Viewer-gated.** A session is captured only while at least one browser is watching it. The
 *    loop starts on the first subscriber and stops on the last. So the server's work scales with the
 *    number of open TERMINALS (usually one), never with the size of the fleet.
 *  - **Shared, deduped.** Many readers of the same session share ONE loop and ONE tmux read per
 *    tick; an unchanged frame is sent to nobody. A reader that joins mid-stream is handed the last
 *    frame immediately, so it sees the current screen without waiting for the next change.
 *
 * Injectable on purpose — the backend, the scope check and the clock are passed in — because that is
 * how `createSessionsPoller` is built and tested in this same directory, and it lets the "one loop
 * for N readers / dedup / death ends the stream" behaviour be proven without a tmux server. The
 * decisions that could be silently wrong (what counts as a change, how a capture becomes a frame)
 * live in the pure `terminal-stream.ts`; this module is the orchestration around them.
