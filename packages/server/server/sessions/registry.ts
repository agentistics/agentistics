/**
 * registry.ts — the product's own record of the sessions it started.
 *
 * The BACKEND is authoritative about what exists; this file is authoritative about what those
 * sessions MEAN (which harness, which model, the user's label and note). `reconcileSessions` puts
 * the two together, and neither is allowed to delete the other's facts.
 *
 * Reads never throw: a corrupt or absent file yields an empty registry, because a control center
 * that cannot start because of a bad JSON file is worse than one that has forgotten some labels.
 *
 * The store is bound to a path by `createSessionRegistry`, the same shape `createLocalTagStore`
 * uses — so a test points it at a temp directory and exercises the real filesystem. It follows the
 * same durability rules that file established (`tags-local-store.ts`):
 *  - writes go to `<file>.tmp` and are then renamed over the target, so a crash mid-write leaves
 *    either the old file or the new one — never a truncated one, which `read()` would otherwise
 *    parse-fail on. That matters more here than it sounds: `read()` is deliberately NOT serialized
 *    against writes (see `enqueue` below), so a concurrent reader can observe a file mid-write —
 *    a truncated read that falls back to `[]` is exactly how a corrupt-looking registry made every
 *    running session `unregistered` at once (session-ref.ts's docstring);
 *  - a corrupt file is never overwritten in place: its bytes are moved aside to `<file>.corrupt-*`
 *    before the next write, so a parse failure degrades to "no sessions" instead of erasing them;
 *  - a mutation that changes nothing (`remove` of an id that was never there) does not write at all.
