/**
 * task-next.ts — the orchestration primitives. Pure: it takes a clock, it never reads one.
 *
 * A board driven by several agents has to answer three questions the board itself never asked:
 *
 *  1. **What can I pick up right now?** Not "what is open" — a task blocked by unfinished work, or
 *     one another agent is already inside, is not work available to me. `readyTasks` answers with
 *     the ones that are genuinely free, most urgent first.
 *  2. **Is this mine?** Two agents taking the same task and doing it twice is the failure mode of
 *     every shared queue. `claimTask` is an atomic take, and it takes a LEASE rather than a lock:
 *     an agent that dies holding a task must not remove it from the board forever, with nothing on
 *     screen saying why. `claimState` reads the expiry at the moment the question is asked.
 *  3. **Are we finished?** `boardProgress` is the convergence signal — how much is open, how much
 *     is blocked on something, how much is in hands right now, and whether anything at all is
 *     available to pick up. A coordinator that cannot tell "nothing to do because it is all done"
 *     from "nothing to do because everything is blocked" will re-dispatch forever.
 *
 * The thing this module deliberately does NOT do is decide anything for anyone. It reports what is
 * available and why the rest is not; nothing here starts, stops or approves a session.
