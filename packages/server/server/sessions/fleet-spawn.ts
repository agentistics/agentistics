/**
 * fleet-spawn.ts — PURE. What a START request arriving over HTTP is allowed to ask for.
 *
 * The cockpit's wizard cannot produce an invalid request: it only ever offers the harnesses
 * `startableHarnesses()` returned and the efforts that harness printed in its own `--help`. A
 * request off the wire has no such shape, so the checks the wizard performs by CONSTRUCTION have to
 * be performed here explicitly — and refused in a sentence, never repaired. A spawn is the most
 * powerful thing this server does: it starts a billable coding assistant, with a prompt, in a
 * directory, on this machine.
 *
 * Three rules, each of which exists because the alternative fails silently:
 *
 * - **The directory must be ABSOLUTE.** A relative path resolves against the SERVER's own working
 *   directory, which is wherever `agentop server` happened to be started — not anywhere the caller
 *   named. The session would start somewhere nobody chose and appear, correctly filed, under that
 *   project. Absolute is the only path a caller and this process provably read the same way.
 * - **The harness must be one this machine can START.** The caller passes the list
 *   `startableHarnesses()` produced, so a harness with no spawn spec is refused here for exactly
 *   the reason it is absent from the wizard: it would be offered and then fail.
 * - **An `effort` must be one the CLI itself prints.** `SpawnSpec.efforts` is a genuine closed enum
 *   read off the tool's `--help`; anything else is a usage error the assistant dies on, in a pane
 *   nobody is looking at. A `model`, by contrast, is NEVER validated — `claude --help` documents
 *   `--model` as an alias "or a model's full name", so a fixed list would reject valid input the day
 *   a model ships. It is only refused when the harness has no model flag AT ALL, which is a
 *   different fact: silently dropping it would start a session that is not the one asked for.
 *
 * `attach` is not a field of the request and never can be: attaching needs a real tty, and an HTTP
 * caller has none. A client that wants to enter the session asks for the attach ticket afterwards.
