/**
 * harness-defaults.ts — the model and effort each CLI will use HERE when none is passed.
 *
 * `spawn-spec.ts` holds what the TOOL publishes and, for defaults, holds nothing: measured on all
 * six CLIs, none prints one in its own `--help`, and that module is a pure static table which a
 * per-machine answer could not honestly live in. Its note ends by saying so about kimi — "it is
 * THIS MACHINE's configuration rather than the CLI's".
 *
 * That is a reason not to put the answer in a static table, not a reason to withhold it. This
 * machine's configuration is exactly what the session about to be started will obey, and a picker
 * offering "Default" without saying what the default IS names a thing without naming it — reported
 * as "you are not showing the default values for model and effort". So the answer is read HERE,
 * impurely, at the moment the wizard asks, from the file each CLI documents as its own.
 *
 * EVERY ENTRY NAMES ITS FILE AND KEY, and was verified by reading a real one on 2026-09-05:
 *
 * - claude    `~/.claude/settings.json` → `model`  (e.g. `opus[1m]`). No effort key exists.
 * - codex     `~/.codex/config.toml`    → `model`, `model_reasoning_effort`.
 * - kimi      `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`→ `default_model`, which `kimi --help` names by KEY.
 * - antigravity `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` → `model` (a DISPLAY name, e.g.
 *   `Gemini 3.6 Flash (Medium)`) — shown as read, never mapped onto a `--model` value it may not be.
 * - gemini    `~/.gemini/settings.json` carries no model key. ABSENT, and absent is the answer.
 * - copilot   its user settings file carries no model key. ABSENT.
 *
 * IT NAMES NOTHING ELSE IN THOSE FILES. They also hold credentials — `~/.copilot/config.json`
 * holds a live GitHub token, and the antigravity settings hold a GCP project and a permission
 * allowlist — so this module reads ONE named key per file and `harness-defaults.test.ts` greps its
 * own source and fails if it so much as mentions another. Same guard, and the same reason, as
 * `billing-detect.ts`.
 *
 * A DEFAULT IS A READING, NEVER A CLAIM. An unreadable file, a missing key, a value of the wrong
 * shape and a harness with no such file are all the same answer here: nothing. The picker then says
 * "Default", exactly as it did before, rather than "Default (something we guessed)".
