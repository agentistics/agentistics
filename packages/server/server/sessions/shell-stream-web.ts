/**
 * shell-stream-web.ts — the utility shell's live READ channel, `GET /api/shell/stream?id=<shellId>`.
 *
 * The sibling of `terminal-web.ts`, and deliberately NOT a call into it. Everything generic is
 * shared — the frame shape (`terminal-stream.ts`), the one-loop-per-watched-pane hub with its dedup
 * and its death handling (`terminal-hub.ts`) — so the browser reads the very same frames from both
 * channels and `SessionTerminal` needs no branch. What is NOT shared is the ONE rule each channel
 * keeps: SCOPE. `terminal-web.ts` resolves an id against `managed-sessions.json`; this one resolves
 * it against `shells.json`, which is what stops a shell id ever being answered as a fleet row (and
 * a fleet id ever being answered as a shell).
 *
 * `index.ts` has already refused this path where the exposure profile forbids it (`localShell` in
 * `capability-guard.ts`) and where the user's own `shellEnabled` switch is off. What
 * is left here is the scope check, the stream ceiling and the SSE plumbing.
