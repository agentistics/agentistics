/**
 * control-session.ts — PURE. One server-side `SessionView`, mapped to the `ControlSession` every
 * surface that DRAWS the fleet consumes.
 *
 * It lived inside `cli-start.ts` while the control center was the only thing drawing a session row.
 * `agentop session ls` draws the same table into a plain terminal, and the alternative was a second
 * mapping — which is how the same session ends up wearing one state word in the cockpit and another
 * on the command line, and how a row named by the user keeps its name in one place and loses it in
 * the other. The repo has already paid for that once (`task-reopen.ts`), so the decision is extracted
 * and both sides execute it.
 *
 * Pure and stringless in the sense that matters: every word it emits arrives as an already-localized
 * `CliStrings`, so this module owns no copy of any sentence.

  // (`session-ref.ts`'s `!found` branch — the backend has NO record of this row at all, the

  // flow, and there is no pid left to ever read again) and `v.status === 'running'` with no
  // `activity` read this tick (the backend DOES still have the pane, only this one poll could not
  // capture it — genuinely ambiguous, and the process the fd would belong to may still be alive).
  // Reading only `state === 'exited'` therefore missed the first, and MORE common, of the two ways
  // a process-log harness's row ends up gone: a row still carries no honest sentence and a
  // permanently dead Reopen button after a reboot, which is not an edge case for a machine that
  // gets rebooted. `v.status === 'exited'` covers both the agentop-retired case (`endedAt` set,
  // stamped by `session-view.ts`'s own `finished` check) and a pane the backend still hosts whose
  // command already died on its own — in both, the ORIGINAL process is provably gone either way.
  // `v.status === 'running'` with unread activity is deliberately excluded: that row's process may
  // still be alive, so it stays quiet rather than claim a link is gone that may arrive on the very
  // next poll.
  // WHERE the link came from (LIVE.1), computed from legacy facts only — shipped to every build and
