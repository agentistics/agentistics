 * and a write that fails must leave NO row claiming the file exists, which is only expressible if
 * the bytes land first and the record second.
 *
 * Layout: `<data dir>/task-files/<taskId>/<fileId>`. The name the user gave is kept in the record,
 * never on disk — a name from a browser upload is attacker-controlled, and building a path out of
 * one is how `../../.ssh/authorized_keys` gets written. The id is minted here and is the only thing
 * that ever reaches the filesystem.
