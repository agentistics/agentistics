/**
 * task-attach.ts — PURE. What a session is filed under, and the fact that it is exactly one thing.
 *
 * **A subtask may also be BLOCKED BY sibling subtasks of the same delivery**, and a session cannot
 * be filed under one while any of its blockers is not `done` — "while the subtask that blocked it
 * is not done, the blocked one cannot be started." `planAttach` is where that is decided, for the
 * same reason it is where the task/subtask exclusivity is decided: one rule in one place, so a
 * second surface cannot file a session under blocked work by going around it. A dangling blocker id
 * (the blocking subtask was deleted) is not a live block — the same reconciliation `filedUnder`
 * already applies to a missing subtask.
 *
 * **A session may be filed on the delivery directly, or on one of its subtasks, or both — see the
 * 2026-09-10 spec for why holding both is safe** (`docs/superpowers/specs/
 * 2026-09-10-task-session-hierarchy-design.md`). A delivery is the unit of DELIVERY; a subtask is
 * the unit of WORK. The two are not mutually exclusive: a simple task can hold its sessions
 * directly (no subtasks at all), a task broken into steps can file each session under the subtask
 * it belongs to, and a task can do both at once — direct sessions for the part that was never
 * broken out, plus subtasks for the part that was.
 *
 * This used to be refused outright ("a delivery does not take sessions, the caller must name a
 * subtask"), on the reasoning that allowing both left "did this cost include the subtasks or not"
 * without an answer. That reasoning stopped holding once `rowsOfTask` (`task-report.ts`) turned out
 * to already sum every row by `taskId` regardless of `subtaskId` — the task-level total was never
 * actually ambiguous. What had no answer was one level down: how much a given SUBTASK cost, because
 * a subtask carried no rollup of its own. `task-report.ts`'s per-subtask views close that gap and
 * give the un-broken-out, directly-filed part of a task its own answerable bucket
 * (`subtaskId: null`) instead of a silent, unaccounted-for gap — which is what makes reopening
 * direct filing safe rather than a regression back to the original ambiguity.
 *
 * That is still the whole point of this module: the exclusivity that matters is at the STORAGE
 * level — a session's `subtaskId`/`taskId` pair names exactly one owner, decided in exactly one
 * place — so a second surface cannot invent a session that appears in two lists at once, where a
 * reader would count it twice and neither list would be the truth.
 *
 * The parent id is still STORED beside the subtask id, and that is not a contradiction — it is the
 * derived half of the same fact. A subtask belongs to a task, so a session filed under the subtask
 * is a session of that task, and the delivery's cost has to keep including it (that is what makes
 * the total close: direct sessions + every subtask's = the delivery). The invariant is therefore
 * one-directional and absolute:
 *
 *   `subtaskId` set  ⟹  `taskId` is that subtask's OWN task.
 *
 * Nothing else may write the pair. `planAttach` is the only thing that decides it, so the two ids
 * cannot drift into naming different deliveries — which would put a session's cost on one task and
 * its row on another.
 *
 * MOVING is the operation, never adding: filing under a subtask CLEARS nothing but replaces where
 * the row belongs, and filing under a task clears the subtask outright. Re-filing into a DIFFERENT
 * task clears it too, because a subtask of one delivery cannot own a session of another.
