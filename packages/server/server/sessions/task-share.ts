/**
 * task-share.ts — PURE. Which deliveries leave this machine, and what is left of them when they do.
 *
 * Two independent gates, and keeping them independent is the whole design:
 *
 *  1. **The TASK travels only if its owner said so** — `taskShared`, absent reading as NOT shared.
 *  2. **Its SESSIONS travel only if the connection's sharing rules already let them** —
 *     `sessionShared`, unchanged, decided by the caller and handed here as a set. Sharing a task
 *     may never widen what a repository rule withholds; it only ever adds the task's own record to
 *     what was already travelling.
 *
 * So a shared task whose work sits in a withheld repository ships its record and NONE of its
 * sessions — and `sessionsWithheld` says how many, because a delivery that arrives measured short
 * with nothing on screen explaining why is the same defect as a confident zero.
 *
 * The text is scrubbed by the CALLER through `redactSharedTask` at both boundaries; this module
 * decides membership and shape, never wording.
