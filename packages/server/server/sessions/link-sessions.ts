/**
 * link-sessions.ts — PURE. Which recorded session is the one agentop started?
 *
 * The session manager knows a session by ITS id; the harness records the conversation under its own.
 * Nothing ties the two together on disk, so the link has to be inferred — and this is a metrics
 * store, which is the last place to be lucky.
 *
 * So the rule is: infer only when there is exactly ONE candidate, and stamp nothing otherwise. An
 * unlabelled session is a small, self-correcting disappointment. A label on the WRONG session is a
 * user reading someone else's work under a name they chose themselves, and they have no way to tell.
