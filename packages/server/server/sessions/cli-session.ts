const USAGE = `Usage:
  agentop session <harness> [-p "prompt"] [--bg] [--model <id>] [--effort <level>] [--cwd <path>] [--name "label"] [--notify on|off] [--force]
  agentop session ls     [--all] [--group ${GROUPINGS.join('|')}] [--json]
  agentop session list
  agentop session attach <id|name>
  agentop session kill   <id|name>
  agentop session rename <id|name> "label"
  agentop session note   <id|name> "text"
  agentop session archive|unarchive|delete <ses_…>

  A NATIVE Agentistics session (\`ses_…\`, the engine's own) takes \`kill\` (end), \`rename\`, and the
  three above; a prefix is enough when it is unique. \`archive\` and \`delete\` need it ended first —
  \`delete\` is permanent.

  \`ls\` is the table a PERSON reads: aligned columns, one section per project, and only what is
  running — \`--all\` adds the finished, lost and closed conversations, \`--group\` changes the
  sections. \`list\` stays the tab-separated dump a script can read line by line; both take
  \`--json\` and print the same data.

  \`--force\` starts anyway when this machine cannot hold another assistant session (see the
  memory gate below) — every verb that starts or reopens a process takes it, and it never fails
  silently: the check that was overridden is printed regardless.

  \`--notify off\` starts the session with its notifications muted: no bell, card, sound or desktop
  toast for it, while it still shows as waiting and its events are still recorded. Absent = on. On
  \`batch\` it is a default for the \`--session\`s that follow it, like \`--model\`.

Orchestrating several at once — the form an assistant should use:

  agentop session batch --task "<name>" [--cwd <path>] [--model <id>] [--effort <level>] \\
                       --session "<harness>[@<cwd>]: <prompt>" [--session "..."] [--json] [--force]
  agentop session open  "<task>" [--json] [--force]
  agentop session list  [--json]

  \`batch\` starts every session detached and files them all under one task, so \`open\` brings the
  whole task back later and the cockpit groups them together. \`--cwd\`/\`--model\`/\`--effort\` given
  before the sessions apply to all of them; a \`@<cwd>\` on a session overrides it. \`--json\` prints
  the started ids as data.

  Example — three assistants on one repository, in parallel:

    agentop session batch --task "auth-refactor" --cwd ~/app --json \\
      --session "claude: refactor the token store" \\
      --session "codex: port the tests" \\
      --session "gemini: review the migration"

Harnesses that can be started: ${STARTABLE.join(', ')}

Memory gate: before starting (or reopening) a session, agentop checks whether this machine has
room for it (available memory, minus room kept for one heavy job, and the CPU load) — a refusal
names how many WOULD fit and the biggest consumer, and exits non-zero without starting anything.
\`--wait\` waits for room instead and starts once it frees; \`--force\` starts anyway; a machine
that cannot be measured (no /proc) is never refused.`

/**
 * A reconciled row as `resolveSessionRef` needs it. Unlike the registry alone, this includes
 * `unregistered` rows (the backend hosts them, the registry does not) — `attach`/`kill` resolve
 * against this so a session `list` shows is never one only `list` can name.
