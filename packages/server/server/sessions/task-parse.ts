/**
 * task-parse.ts — PURE. `agentop task …` argv -> a typed command.
 *
 * A TOP-LEVEL command rather than a `session` subcommand, because a task is not a session: it
 * outlives every row filed under it, and `agentop session task <ref> "<name>"` already means
 * something else (it files ONE row). The two verbs that act on a task from a session row (`open`,
 * `finish`) deliberately take the ROW's own task rather than a name, so a caller cannot reach
 * someone else's work; that stays true and this command is the other door.
 *
 * Pure, so the whole grammar is tested without touching the task book.
