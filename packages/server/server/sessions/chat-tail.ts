 * Only Claude Code has an exact live-session -> conversation-id link
 * (`harness-sessions.ts`'s `byManagedId`), so this is Claude-only; every other harness keeps the
 * existing raw-tail behavior in `sessions-host.ts`. Absence here is never an error, only "not
 * available for this row" — the same rule every other enrichment in this file follows.
 *
 * Claude encodes a project's absolute path into its directory name by replacing `/` and `.` with
 * `-` (`nay-sessions.ts` uses the same encoding), but that encoding is documented as ambiguous for
 * directory names that already contain dashes (`data.ts`). Rather than trust it, the resolver
 * treats the conversation id (a UUID) as the reliable key: it tries the direct encoded path first
 * — cheap, and right the overwhelming majority of the time — and falls back to a one-time scan of
 * `PROJECTS_DIR` for a file literally named `<id>.jsonl`, exactly as `transcript-search.ts` does.
 * Both the hit and the miss are cached per conversation id, so a resolved (or unresolvable) session
 * is never re-scanned on a later poll.

 * `pending` rule — which still applies to the NEWEST event only, because "no text has followed
 * this tool call yet" is a statement about right now, and the same shape earlier in the file is an
 * ordinary tool call whose follow-up already exists further down.
