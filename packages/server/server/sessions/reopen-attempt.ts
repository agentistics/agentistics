/**
 * reopen-attempt.ts — the ONE row-level "try to reopen this conversation" step, run inside the
 * resume lock (`resume-lock.ts`).
 *
 * Pulled out of `cli-start.ts`'s `reopenEntries` for exactly the reason `resumeSessionLocked` was
 * pulled out of `resumeSession`: the lock has to wrap a plain function, and a function with its I/O
 * injected is one a test can drive without a real registry, a real backend or a real spawner. Before
 * this existed, a revert of the `withResumeLock` wrapping — the actual fix for the double-spawn race
 * — passed the whole `bun test` suite clean; nothing exercised it except a live, manually-driven
 * concurrent request replay.
 *
 * This module holds no IMPLEMENTATION of "fresh state", "who holds it" or "spawn" — those stay in
 * `cli-start.ts`, which is the only place that knows how to ask the real registry, the real backend
 * and the real spawner. What lives here is the ORDER those three questions get asked in, and what
 * each answer means — which is exactly the part a concurrent-request test needs to hold still.
