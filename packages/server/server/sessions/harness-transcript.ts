/**
 * harness-transcript.ts — WHICH harnesses can have their conversation read, and how.
 *
 * `Record<HarnessId, HarnessTranscript | null>`, so the compiler asks about a new harness on the
 * day it is added and a reader that does not exist is ABSENT rather than a call that fails. The
 * caller turns a `null` into a sentence; it never turns it into an empty conversation, which is the
 * defect this module was written to remove. Measured 2026-09-05 on a live antigravity session:
 * `GET /api/fleet/chat` answered `{"turns":[],"live":true}` and `SessionChat.tsx` drew a completely
 * blank pane with nothing on it explaining why — no reader, no refusal, no words.
 *
 * A READER IS ONLY EVER OFFERED A CONVERSATION ID THAT IS EXACT. `SessionView.conversationId` is
 * filled solely from `ManagedSession.conversationId`, which exists only because agentop handed that
 * id to the CLI (`SpawnSpec.assignId`, or `resume`) — verified on the live agy session, whose
 * `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` reads `agy --conversation 01d0814f-…` for exactly the id the registry
 * holds. The harness-and-directory INFERENCE behind `resume` never reaches here: it is good enough
 * to offer a reopen a person confirms by title, and putting SOME OTHER conversation from the same
 * folder on screen under this session's name is a confident wrong answer the reader cannot detect.
 *
 * Two budgets, deliberately. `read` is the CHAT VIEW's and reads the conversation; `readRecent` is
 * the 5 s fleet poll's and reads only the end of the file through `transcript-window.ts`. A poll
 * that reads whole transcripts is what made `/api/fleet` answer in 36 s cold — see that module's
 * header for the measurement.

 * extra turn parsed instead of a second return channel through four pure parsers and their tests.
 *
 * THE `+ 1` IS WHAT MAKES IT EXACT, and it is the whole reason `older` can be REQUIRED of every

 * conversation of exactly `max` turns a window — a false sentence in the reassuring direction — so

 * takes "latest" or an index rather than an id, so an entry would have been code nothing could

 *
 * That id is a PATH, so `resolve` treats it as untrusted: exactly two segments, neither of them a
 * traversal, or it answers `null`. An id reaching a `readFile` is the one place this table touches
 * something shaped like user input.
 *
 * The format was measured twice, and the second reading is the one in `gemini-chat.ts`. The note
 * that used to live here called it "a patch log, not one message per line", which was half right
 * and cost the product months of gemini sessions: the SEED is a patch (`{"$set":{messages:[…]}}`,
 * once, empty for a fresh session) and every turn AFTER it is appended as its own line. Reading
 * only the seed is why `gemini-parse.ts` dropped 27 of the 34 chat files on this machine and why
