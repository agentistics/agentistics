/**
 * spawn-spec.ts — PURE. What argv each harness needs to start an interactive session.
 *
 * A `Record<HarnessId, …>`, never an array: TypeScript accepts an array literal with a member
 * missing, and CLAUDE.md records five surfaces that silently lost a harness exactly that way. A
 * harness whose entry is `null` is not spawnable by us yet, and every caller must therefore refuse
 * it by name rather than offering a verb that fails.
 *
 * EVERY flag below was read from that tool's own `--help` — claude, codex and kimi on 2026-08-12,
 * gemini, copilot and antigravity on 2026-08-13. A flag that could not be verified is absent, not
 * guessed.
 *
 * MODELS follow the same rule, and it took a second pass to get right. The suggestions used to be
 * "the ids this machine has actually run", read from the local session store — which is not the
 * same question. What a harness REPORTS a conversation ran under and what its `--model` flag
 * ACCEPTS are different strings, and shipping the first as the second is how the picker came to
 * offer values the CLI refuses. Measured 2026-09-02, on the versions named below: of copilot's
 * three shipped ids only `auto` was accepted (`claude-sonnet-4.6` and `gpt-5.3-codex` both came
 * back `Model "…" from --model flag is not available.`, and so did `gpt-5.4`, copilot's OWN help
 * example); of gemini's three, `gemini-2.5-pro` is refused by the API outright; and agy's single
 * `gemini-3.6-flash` — the technical id `antigravity-protobuf.ts` decodes out of the conversation
 * DB — is not a value `--model` takes at all, its own `agy models` listing only ever naming the
 * effort-suffixed `gemini-3.6-flash-high|medium|low`.
 *
 * So: A VALUE APPEARS HERE ONLY IF THE CLI ITSELF NAMES IT — in `--help`, in a listing subcommand,
 * or by answering with it when driven. A harness whose CLI publishes no list gets an EMPTY list and
 * a sentence saying why, which makes the picker ABSENT rather than wrong; a plausible id sourced
 * from anywhere else is a guess, and a guess here fails after the session has already started.
 * The lists stay a convenience and never a validation set (`planSpawn` does not check membership):
 * every one of these CLIs also accepts a full model name, and several of them scope what is
 * available to the signed-in account, so refusing an unlisted value would reject valid input.
 *
 * DEFAULTS (`defaultModel` / `defaultEffort`) FOLLOW THE SAME RULE AND ARE, TODAY, ALL ABSENT.
 *
 * A wizard that says "the assistant's default" names a thing without saying what it is, so the
 * fields exist to say "Default (sonnet)" wherever the CLI publishes the answer. Measured
 * 2026-09-04 on the versions below, NONE of the six does — and in four of the six the absence is
 * EVIDENCE rather than an omission, because those help formatters print a default wherever one
 * exists and print none here:
 *
 * - claude 2.1.261 — `claude --help`. `--model` documents the aliases and a full name; `--effort`
 *   documents `(low, medium, high, xhigh, max)`. Commander prints `(default: …)` on eight other
 *   options in the same output and on neither of these two.
 * - codex-cli 0.113.0 — `codex --help`, `codex exec --help`. `-m, --model <MODEL>` names no value.
 *   This help prints no `[default …]` anywhere, so its silence proves nothing either way; it
 *   simply does not publish one.
 * - gemini 0.55.1 — `gemini --help`. yargs prints `[default: false]` on six other options;
 *   `-m, --model  Model  [string]` carries none.
 * - copilot 1.0.82 — `copilot --help`, `copilot help config`. That config page writes "defaults
 *   to …" 37 times; the `model` key is not one of them. `--help` names `auto` as something you MAY
 *   pass, which is not the same as what happens when you pass nothing.
 * - antigravity 1.1.25 — `agy --help`, `agy models`. The help prints `(default …)` on three other
 *   flags and none on `--model` or `--effort`; `agy models` marks no row as current.
 * - kimi 0.38.0 — `kimi --help`. `--model` says "Defaults to default_model in config.toml", which
 *   names a KEY, not a value. `kimi provider list` does print a resolved default, but it is THIS
 *   MACHINE's configuration rather than the CLI's — a per-machine answer cannot live in a pure
 *   static table, and it is the user's own setting, not something the tool publishes.
 *
 * So every entry below omits both fields, and the wizard keeps its honest wording. The day one of
 * these CLIs prints its default, add it HERE with the command in a comment — never anywhere else.

/**
 * Can agentop ever know EXACTLY which conversation a fresh session of this harness is writing?
 *
 * THREE ways exist and this is all of them:
 *
 *  1. we told the CLI which id to use (`assignId` — claude, copilot);
 *  2. the harness keeps a record of its own live sessions that can be matched back to our row
 *     (`HARNESS_SESSION_SOURCES` — Claude's `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`, which carries the tmux
 *     session name we started it under);
 *  3. the harness holds a per-process LOG open that names the conversation it created
 *     (`HARNESS_PROCESS_LOGS` — antigravity, reached through the tmux pane pid's own file
 *     descriptors; see `agy-conversation.ts`).
 *
 * The third was added because agy has neither of the first two and the fallback everything else
 * leans on is closed for it in particular: its store record carries no `project_path` for a session
 * agentop started, so even the harness-and-directory guess had nothing to match on. Its chat view
 * was therefore permanently empty while its terminal worked, which is the defect this answers.
 *
 * `false` is still the answer for codex, kimi and gemini, and it must be SAID rather than papered
 * over: everything downstream then falls back to `conversationForProcess`, which matches by harness
 * and directory and therefore gives every session of one repository the same conversation. That
 * guess is good enough to OFFER a reopen a person confirms by title, and not good enough to be
 * presented as the conversation this row is in. The same rule `HARNESS_CAPABILITIES` applies to a
 * metric, applied to a link.
 *
 * STATED LIMIT: route 3 is a `/proc` read, so it answers nothing off Linux. That degrades to no
 * link, which `chat-web.ts` reports as "this session has no linked conversation yet" — true, and
 * the one thing this may never do is claim a conversation it cannot name.
