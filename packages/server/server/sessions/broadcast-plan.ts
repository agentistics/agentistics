/**
 * broadcast-plan.ts — PURE: one prompt, several sessions. What goes where, and what comes back.
 *
 * The most powerful thing on the fleet screen. `promptSession` types a line into ONE session after
 * re-reading its screen; this asks for the same line in several, which multiplies both the use and
 * the damage. So the rules here are about what it REFUSES.
 *
 * ## Every session is still checked on its own
 *
 * This plan says which sessions are worth ASKING about. It does not send anything and it does not
 * decide whether a send is safe: `promptSession` re-reads each screen at the moment it writes,
 * because a session that was working five seconds ago may be sitting on a permission prompt now,
 * where a typed sentence is an answer to a question nobody read. A broadcast that skipped that
 * check to save five round trips would be the one gesture in this product able to answer a dozen
 * dialogs at once.
 *
 * That is why `plan` carries no "safe" flag. The only thing it can know from a poll-old list is
 * which rows could not possibly take a prompt — and it says so per row, so the refusals are
 * readable BEFORE anything is sent rather than as a list of failures afterwards.
 *
 * ## The rules
 *
 * - **A session that is not running is REOPENED FIRST, when it can be.** A prompt to a `lost` or
 *   `exited` row used to have nowhere to go and was skipped; asked for directly, a ticked row that
 *   the machine knows how to reopen is now brought back and then written to. The plan only SAYS
 *   which ones need it (`needsReopen`) — the reopening, and waiting for it to be real, is the
 *   host's job, exactly as the writing is.
 * - **A row that cannot be reopened is still excluded, by name, and with its own reason.** "It is
 *   not running" and "it is not running and nothing here knows how to bring it back" send a person
 *   to different places, so `not-reopenable` is a separate code. It is reported rather than
 *   dropped: a count that shrinks between what was ticked and what was sent is the thing that makes
 *   somebody re-send.
 * - **A session with a DIALOG OPEN is excluded, by name.** The row already knows this — it is the
 *   same rule the composer keeps — and a sentence typed into a dialog goes into its filter, where
 *   the submit takes whatever is highlighted.
 * - **AN EMPTY PROMPT IS REFUSED.** Not "sent to nobody": refused, so the mistake is visible.
 * - **AN EMPTY SELECTION IS REFUSED**, and never read as "everything". Same rule, same reason, as
 *   `selectFell`.
 * - **A cap.** `MAX_BROADCAST` sessions at once. Beyond that this stops being a message and becomes
 *   a fleet command nobody can take back, and the number is small enough to read in a confirmation.
