/**
 * file-lock.ts — a lock ACROSS PROCESSES, for a file several agentop processes read-modify-write.
 *
 * `registry.ts` serialises its mutations with a promise chain, which is correct and is only half
 * the problem: agentop runs as SEVERAL processes — the systemd server, the cockpit, and every
 * one-shot `agentop session …` — and a promise chain is per process. Two of them reading the same
 * `managed-sessions.json`, each adding its own record, each writing the whole list back, is a lost
 * write every time they overlap.
 *
 * MEASURED, not theorised. Two sessions started minutes apart came back with the same `createdAt`
 * to the millisecond and no `label` at all — the signature of records that were erased and then
 * re-created by adoption, which cannot know a name. That is why "sessoes criadas por aqui nao sao
 * renomeadas com o nome do titulo que coloquei" and "renomear sessoes nao esta renomeando de
 * verdade" are ONE bug: both write a label into a file that another process overwrites.
 *
 * `mkdir` IS THE LOCK. It is the one filesystem operation that is atomic and fails when the target
 * exists, on every platform this runs on, with no dependency and no daemon — `open(O_EXCL)` is
 * equally atomic but leaves a file that looks like data, and a directory beside a JSON file reads
 * as what it is. `proper-lockfile` does exactly this and is not worth a dependency here.
 *
 * A LOCK MUST NEVER BE ABLE TO WEDGE THE PRODUCT. Every rule below exists for that:
 *
 * - It is STALE after `STALE_MS`. A process killed between acquire and release leaves the directory
 *   behind, and without expiry the next start of agentop would hang forever on a lock nobody holds.
 *
 * **A BLOCKED ACQUIRER MAY NEVER DELETE THE LOCK IT IS BLOCKED ON, and the first version did.** On
 * a failed `mkdir` it stat'd the directory, and a stat that threw `ENOENT` — the lock released in
 * the instant between the two calls — was treated as "stale" and answered with
 * `rm(dir, {recursive: true})`. By the time that `rm` ran another process could already hold a NEW
 * lock in that same path, and deleting it left BOTH of them believing they held it. Measured with
 * six concurrent processes taking the lock 25 times each: **31 overlapping acquisitions out of
 * 150**, with the age-based expiry never once firing (`staleOld: 0`) — the destructive `rm` was the
 * whole of it. That is the residual loss behind sessions whose registry record disappeared.
 *
 * So a vanished lock is answered by RETRYING, which touches nothing, and a genuinely abandoned one
 * is taken over by `rename` — the one operation where exactly one racer can win. Whoever renames it
 * aside owns the right to remove it; everyone else fails the rename and goes back to racing.
 * - The wait is BOUNDED. Past `WAIT_MS` the caller runs anyway — because the alternative is
 *   refusing to record a session that has already been spawned, and a lost label is a smaller harm
 *   than a live session with no record at all. It says so through `contended`, so a caller can log
 *   it rather than pretend it held the lock.
 * - Release NEVER throws. A failed cleanup becomes a stale lock, which the next acquirer clears.
 *
 * **ONLY `EEXIST` IS CONTENTION, and treating every failed `mkdir` as contention wedged the
 * product.** The lock directory is created WITHOUT `recursive` — it has to be, `mkdir` is atomic
 * only on its own last segment — so on a machine where the parent does not exist yet (a fresh
 * `~/.agentistics`) it failed with `ENOENT`. That failure was read as "somebody holds it", the
 * follow-up `stat` of the lock found nothing, `inspectLock` answered `retry`, and the loop went
 * round again with no sleep and no deadline — forever. It surfaced as 42 uploader tests timing out
 * on a CI runner whose home had no `~/.agentistics`, and it is the same hang a real first-time
 * machine meets: `loadTaskBoard` seeds the task statuses through this lock on every push cycle, so
 * the push to a central never finished. Measured: `loadTaskBoard()` still pending after 6s under an
 * empty HOME, instant with the directory present. So the parent is created first, a failure that is
 * not `EEXIST` never counts as someone else's lock, and even the vanished-lock retry answers to the
 * deadline.
