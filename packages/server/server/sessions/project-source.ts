/**
 * project-source.ts — where the wizard's candidates come from.
 *
 * THREE sources, merged, in descending order of how much we know about them:
 *
 *  1. **History** — the local consolidate store. Places you have actually worked, so they can be
 *     ranked by recency and carry their repository.
 *  2. **The home directory, walked** — because any folder should be startable. Limiting the wizard
 *     to places with history made it useless for the most ordinary case there is: a repository
 *     cloned five minutes ago.
 *  3. **A path typed in full** — the escape hatch for anywhere else on the machine, including
 *     outside `$HOME`.
 *
 * All three are read from disk directly rather than through the API, for the same reason
 * `conversations.ts` is: the control center must work with the server stopped, which is exactly the
 * state a user is in when they open it to start something.
