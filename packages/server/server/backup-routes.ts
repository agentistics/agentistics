 * so is the whole reason this is not called "delete": a person pressing it wants to stop sending
 * from this machine, not to destroy the copies that are the point of having sent them. Reconnecting
 * the same repository later finds them, and the "already uploaded?" check recognises them.
 *
 * Idempotent: a machine with no config is already disconnected, and reporting that as a failure
 * would send somebody looking for a problem that is not there.
