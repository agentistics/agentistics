/**
 * capability-guard.ts — maps a request path to the local capability it needs, and turns a

 * Kept separate from index.ts so the mapping is unit-testable and so a newly added local-power
 * route is a one-line registration instead of a scattered `if`.
 *
 * SECURITY: these routes execute shell commands, spawn coding-assistant CLIs, read the host's
 * raw conversation transcripts, or rewrite ~/.claude.json. They must be unreachable on an
 * internet-exposed instance regardless of who is authenticated — a `member` account is not a
 * reason to hand out a shell. A route that is NOT registered here is assumed harmless, so a
 * missed registration is a vulnerability, not an oversight.
