// shared socket would mean whichever connection reconciled first "owns" it and every OTHER
// central reads this machine as permanently offline while it is pushing fine. Every piece of
// mutable state that used to be a module-level singleton (the socket itself, the backoff index,
// the live-reporting timer) is therefore keyed by connection id.
//
// On-demand chat retrieval (the former 'fetch-chat' request / 'chat-result' reply) has been
// removed — the member never sends chat content to the central over this channel.
//
// Reconnects with exponential backoff on close/error, per connection.
// startAgentClient() is idempotent — safe to call multiple times.
// Never throws; all errors are swallowed internally.

 *   - A solo server driven with an 8s `/api/data` poll (this loop's cadence, same code path)
 *     reproduced it: 188 MB -> 700 MB within four minutes.
 *
 * This is the same defect `peekPushContext()` in team-uploader.ts was added for, one module over:
