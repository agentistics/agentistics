/**
 * upgrade-web.ts — `POST /api/upgrade`: the dashboard's own "update now".
 *
 * The modal has always printed `agentop upgrade` and left the person to find a terminal. The whole
 * point of this route is that they do not have to — and the whole reason it is its own module is
 * that running it correctly is NOT "spawn the command".
 *
 * **THE UPGRADE MUST NOT BE THIS PROCESS'S CHILD.** `upgrade.ts` restarts whatever `agentop server`
 * it can find, and it finds them with `pgrep -f 'agentop.*(server|start)'` while excluding its own
 * `pid` and its `ppid` — the exclusion that makes running it from a terminal safe. Spawned as a
 * child of the server, the server IS the `ppid`: it would be skipped, the upgrade would report
 * success, and the machine would go on serving the old bundle with a new binary on disk. So the
 * child is DETACHED and `unref`'d — its parent becomes init, nothing is excluded, and the server it
 * restarts is the one that started it.
 *
 * That restart is also why there is no "and then tell the browser it worked": the process answering
 * would be killed mid-sentence. The route answers `started` and the PAGE watches `/api/version`
 * until the machine comes back on the new version — an honest poll rather than a promise made by
 * something about to be replaced.
 *
 * ONE AT A TIME. A second press while one runs is refused in words rather than starting a second
 * download over the same binary path.
