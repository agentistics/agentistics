/**
 * transcript-state.ts — reading a LIVE Claude transcript by what it has WRITTEN SINCE LAST TIME.
 *
 * The IO half of `transcript-cursor.ts`, which holds every rule this makes a decision with and
 * explains why the rules are what they are. In one sentence: `parse-cache.ts` spares a transcript
 * that has not changed, a live one changes on every turn, and so the parser re-read and re-parsed
 * the whole file on every rebuild for as long as its session ran. This keeps the walk instead.
 *
 * WHAT A CALLER GETS is a `ClaudeParseState` that has been folded over every complete line of the
 * file, however it got there — resumed from a cursor, or rebuilt from scratch because the cursor
 * could not be trusted. The two are indistinguishable in the answer and are distinguished in
 * `mode`, which exists so the saving can be MEASURED rather than assumed.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO is decide anything about sessions. It reads one file and folds it; whether
 * that state becomes a `SessionMeta` or an `EnrichResult` is `parse-cache-jsonl.ts`'s business, and
 * both finish from the same walk — which is also why the memo is keyed on the FILE alone and not on
 * the caller: the facts a transcript carries do not depend on who asked.
