Carry this machine's whole agentistics history to another one.

  A backup always holds your computed metrics and a repository manifest that can rebuild every
  checkout, worktree, unpushed branch and uncommitted diff. --with-archive adds the mirrored
  transcripts; --with-raw adds the harness directories themselves.

  \`agentop backup config\` with no flags prints the current layers, schedule and schedule-layers.
  Layers are metrics,repos,archive,raw — metrics is always included even if you leave it out.
  A schedule never carries the repos layer; \`agentop backup\` (or the cockpit's \`b\`) is what
  rebuilds the repository manifest.

  \`--at HOUR\` anchors a \`daily\`/\`custom\` (also \`weekly\`) run to a fixed local hour — for
  \`custom\` this is the GRID's anchor, e.g. \`schedule custom 8 --at 9\` runs every 8h at
  09/17/01, forever, never drifting to whatever time the machine happens to reconnect at.
  \`--days mon,wed,fri\` (or \`0-6\`, Sunday first) restricts \`daily\`/\`custom\` to those weekdays;
  absent or empty means every day. If the machine was off through a scheduled time, it catches up
  immediately when the NEXT normal slot is still more than 2h away, and otherwise just waits for it
  — never more than one catch-up run, however many slots were missed while it was off.

  Live credentials are NEVER included. \`restore\` prints each one and the command that
  re-establishes it.

  \`github setup <url>\` connects a PRIVATE GitHub repository to hold versioned backups (asks for a
  token, never echoed). The repository must already be private and the token must be able to push
  to it — both are checked before anything is written. \`github status\` prints what is configured.
  Setup also installs \`${BACKUP_DOC_WORKFLOW_PATH}\`, which keeps a \`BACKUPS.md\` in that repository
  up to date on every release; \`github install-workflow\` installs it on its own (idempotent — it
  never overwrites one that is already there).

  \`agentop restore <repository-url>\` is the path back on a machine that has nothing but the URL:
  it asks for a token if none is stored, lists releases, shows what would be downloaded and asks,
  verifies the sha256 against the release body before touching anything, and only then hands off to
  the ordinary restore above. \`--release <tag>\` restores a specific release instead of the newest,
  and \`--from <machine>\` takes the newest backup of ONE machine — needed whenever several machines
  version to the same repository, where "the newest" would otherwise be whichever ran last.
  \`agentop restore github --list <url>\` shows what is there without downloading anything.`
