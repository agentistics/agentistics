/**
 * github-seed.ts — a repository with no commits cannot hold a release.
 *
 * Measured against the real API on 2026-09-06: a freshly created GitHub repository, with the
 * "add a README" box left unticked, refuses `POST /releases` with
 * `422 Validation Failed — Repository is empty.` That is exactly the repository a person creates
 * when they follow the instruction "create a private repository", so the FIRST backup of every new
 * setup failed, and the toast said only "upload failed".
 *
 * Rather than telling the user to go and make a commit, the upload makes one: a README, through
 * the Contents API, which is the only way to create the first commit without a local clone — it
 * creates the default branch as a side effect of writing a file to it.
 *
 * It is a README rather than an empty file on purpose. This repository is going to sit in somebody's
 * account holding nothing but release assets; opening it months later and finding one file that
 * says what it is for is the difference between a backup store and a mystery.
