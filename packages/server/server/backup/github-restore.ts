/**
 * github-restore.ts — the case wave G3 exists for: numa maquina recem-formatada you have the
 * repository URL and nothing else.
 *
 * There is no local `backups.jsonl` here, no stored config, no expected hash on this disk — every
 * fact this module needs comes from the far side: the release LISTING (which tag, which asset) and
 * the release BODY (`backup-github.ts`'s `buildReleaseBody`/`parseReleaseBody` pair), which is the
 * only place the sha256 survives once the machine that made it is gone.
 *
 * The three steps are deliberately separate functions so each can be proven on its own:
 *
 * 1. `listGithubReleases` + `pickBackupRelease` — find WHICH release, never an arbitrary
 *    hand-made one (the same `isBackupTag` guard `github-retention.ts` uses).
 * 2. `pickBackupAsset` — find WHICH asset in that release actually holds the archive.
 * 3. `downloadBackupAsset` — pull the bytes down and hash them against the release body's sha256
 *    BEFORE anything is handed to `restoreMetrics`. A mismatch is a refusal that KEEPS the file
 *    (so it can be inspected) and never claims the bytes are good.
 *
 * `downloadBackupRelease` composes all three into the one call the CLI drives, with an injectable
 * `confirmDownload` — showing what would be downloaded and asking is a CLI concern, but the
 * decision of whether to proceed has to happen INSIDE this function, before the download, so a
 * test can assert a decline never reaches the network.
 *
 * **Phase two must not re-download.** `agentop restore <url>` (phase one) already leaves the
 * archive sitting in `destDir`; `agentop restore <url> --repos` (phase two) is a SEPARATE CLI
 * invocation with no memory of that, and re-fetching a 600 MB asset it already has on disk is pure
 * waste. `findReusableArchive` checks for exactly that file — same name, same `destDir` — and
 * hashes it against the release body's own sha256 before trusting it: a file that is THERE but
 * does not match is never reused, only ignored and overwritten by the real download. This is the
 * cheap fix, not a cache — it reuses only what a previous run of this same function already wrote.
