/**
 * github-upload.ts — the confirmation ladder: release, upload, confirm, verify, and only then
 * delete the local copy.
 *
 * The user asked for "0 espaco pra falhas" and the local file is deleted on the strength of this
 * module's answer, so every rung either earns the next one or the whole thing stops with the local
 * file intact:
 *
 * 1. create the release (tag `backup-<ISO>`, never a draft, never a prerelease) with the manifest
 *    summary in the BODY — the one place the expected sha256 can live once this machine is gone.
 * 2. upload the archive to the release's own `upload_url`.
 * 3. RE-READ the release: the asset must be listed, `state === 'uploaded'`, and its `size` must
 *    match the archive's measured size exactly. This only trusts GitHub's own metadata.
 * 4. DOWNLOAD the asset back and hash it. Steps 1-3 prove GitHub recorded something; only this
 *    proves the bytes that arrived are the bytes that left — the cost (re-downloading what was
 *    just uploaded) is real and is why its elapsed time is reported rather than hidden.
 * 5. only now, and only if `deleteLocalAfterUpload`, delete the local file — and record the
 *    deletion with `recordPrune`, so the history shows a deliberate act rather than a loss.
 *
 * Any rung failing returns `{ ok: false }` with a sentence naming what happened, and the local file
 * is never touched past that point. Nothing here retries — a caller (the CLI, the daemon) decides
 * whether to try again on its own next run.
