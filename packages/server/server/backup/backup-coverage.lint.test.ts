/**
 * backup-coverage.lint.test.ts — nothing agentop writes under `~/.agentistics` may be UNDECIDED.
 *
 * A path is decided when it is either carried by a backup source or named in the exclusion table
 * with a reason. Neither is a silent omission: the file is not in the archive, nothing says so,
 * and the loss is discovered on the machine that no longer has the original.
 *
 * This greps the server's own source for the literals that name those paths, the same shape
 * `tokens.lint.test.ts` and `releaseWorkflow.lint.test.ts` use — so a directory a future feature
 * starts writing fails this test until somebody decides about it, rather than being remembered.
 * `event-subscriptions.json` (the event channel's subscriptions — tasks, notify targets, notes: a
 * person's configuration) was missing from the backup for exactly the reason this test exists.
