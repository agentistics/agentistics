/**
 * backup-plan.ts — PURE. What a backup carries, and what it refuses to carry.
 *
 * Two things live here and nowhere else.
 *
 * **The layer model.** A backup is up to four layers, each independently selectable and each
 * recorded in the manifest, so a restore knows what it is holding rather than inferring it from
 * what it happens to find. `metrics` is not optional: a backup without it restores nothing.
 *
 * **The exclusion table, with a reason per row.** Three reasons, and they are not
 * interchangeable:
 *
 *  - `secret` — a live credential. Excluded by decision: a tarball holding these is a master key
 *    to the user's accounts, and it travels on a pendrive. The cost (five minutes of re-login) is
 *    paid deliberately, and `omittedSecrets()` is what lets the restore NAME each one and the
 *    command that re-establishes it. Nothing here goes missing in silence.
 *  - `regenerable` — a cache or a log. It rebuilds itself and costs megabytes.
 *  - `runtime` — true on the old machine and false on the new one. `managed-sessions.json` names
 *    tmux sessions that will not exist; restoring it produces a fleet of rows pointing at nothing.
 *
 * `backup-plan.test.ts` greps this file and re-probes every credential path, so a rule deleted in
 * a refactor fails the build rather than shipping a leak.
