/**
 * backup.ts — IO. Walk the sources, measure them, hand tar an explicit file list, record what
 * happened.
 *
 * ## tar receives a LIST, never an exclude pattern
 *
 * The exclusion rules live in `backup-plan.ts` and are tested there, including the grep that no
 * credential can pass. Handing tar `--exclude` globs would create a SECOND expression of those
 * rules, in a different language, with different escaping — and the one that runs would be the
 * untested one. So the walk applies `excludeFor` per file and tar is given the survivors through
 * `-T`. A file that is not in the list cannot be in the archive.
 *
 * ## The only compressed number in the system is measured here
 *
 * `archiveBytes` is `statSync` on the finished file. Nothing predicts it (see `backup-size.ts`).
