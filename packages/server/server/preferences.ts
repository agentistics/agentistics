 *
 * Why the restriction exists — a real, reproduced defect, not tidiness. `LEGACY_PREFERENCES_PATH`
 * is derived from `CLAUDE_DIR`, the one persisted path in this product that is NOT under
 * `AGENTISTICS_DATA_DIR`, so the migration read it no matter which data dir the instance was
 * given. Starting a server with a brand-new, empty `AGENTISTICS_DIR` therefore wrote a
 * `preferences.json` into it holding a `mode: 'member'` connection to a central the operator
 * never configured — INCLUDING ITS BEARER TOKEN — and then created the connection state files
 * for it. A second instance on one host, a container with its own volume and a test rig each
 * silently inherited a credential, and would have pushed to that central under it. That is the
 * same class of defect config.ts's header records (three isolated machines each pushing 108
 * sessions belonging to none of them), reached through the one path that had escaped the rule:
 * a path derived from `AGENTISTICS_DIR` may never be seeded from a location outside it.
 *
 * The legacy import itself is still correct where it belongs — `~/.claude/agentistics-preferences.json`
 * is the predecessor of `$HOME/.agentistics/preferences.json` and of nothing else, so native
 * installs that predate the move keep their saved choices.
