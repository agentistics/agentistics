/**
 * cli-start.ts — the logic behind the `agentop` control center.
 *
 * This module owns everything the control center DOES: what the current mode is, which services
 * are up, and what each action performs. The Ink layer (`@agentistics/tui/control`) owns only how
 * that is drawn — the two meet at `ControlHost`, implemented here, whose methods return an
 * already-localized `ActionResult` instead of printing.
 *
 * Nothing here may write to stdout while the alternate screen is live: a stray line lands in a
 * buffer Ink is repainting and corrupts the frame. There are three ways an action obeys that, and
 * which one it takes is a judgement about what the action SAYS:
 *
 *  - `captureOutput` — it prints a sentence. The prints are swallowed and the last line becomes the
 *    failure message in the status line.
 *  - `streamOutput` — its output is the point and there is nothing to ask. `docker compose up
 *    --build`, `bun run bin`: the child is spawned with BOTH pipes captured (never
 *    `inherit`, never a tty of its own) and every line it produces is published on the output
 *    channel, which the control center draws into a pane. This is what replaced leaving the screen.
 *  - `suspend` — it asks a QUESTION, so it needs the real terminal. A docker foreground start is the whole
 *    of that list: it needs the tty, and a prompt streamed into a pane is a
 *    question nobody can answer.
 *
 * Language follows `--lang en|pt`, else `preferences.lang` (shared with the web), else English;
 * the in-app toggle persists to that same preference.
 *
 * Non-interactive stdin (a pipe or a systemd unit) never opens the control center and behaves like
 * `agentop server`. runStart() returns a numeric exit code or the sentinel 'foreground' (cli.ts
 * then starts the in-process server and does not exit).

 * Retry the process-log link for ONE freshly spawned row, on this machine's own schedule —
 * fire-and-forget, never awaited by the spawn response.
 *
 * ## Why the ordinary 5s poll is not enough
 *
 * `readProcessConversation` is this harness's ONLY chance at an exact link (see
 * `HARNESS_PROCESS_LOGS` — antigravity has no `assignId` and no session record of its own), and it
 * is a `/proc/<pid>/fd` read: once the process exits, the chance is gone forever, and nothing can
 * recover it after the fact (see `session-view.ts`'s `metricsOf`, which refuses to guess one back
 * from a directory). That chance was being handed entirely to whichever browser tab happened to be
 * polling `/api/fleet` — and a short-lived session (killed at agy's own first-run trust dialog, or
 * simply closed) can end before that tab's next tick, OR before it ever polls at all: the wizard's
 * own `waitForRow` stops the INSTANT the new row appears in a fleet read, which is often under a
 * second after spawn — well before agy has written the line this reads (measured ~1-1.5s). Reported
 * as a session started from the web whose chat pane never has anything to show, and that cannot be
 * reopened once it ends, both are this: the window this file owns is the whole of the fix, because
 * nothing downstream can recover a link this machine never captured.
 *
 * So this machine gives the process its own several seconds, independent of any client — a session
 * created from `agentop session batch`, with no browser open at all, gets exactly the same chance a
 * dashboard tab would have given it.
 *
 * ## FIXWAVE 1, Finding 1 — the collision guard applies HERE too, and matters more here
 *
 * agy names its log by SECOND, so a `session batch` launch — several antigravity rows spawned
 * together, each running this exact loop — is precisely the shape that collides: two of them can
 * share one log file, and (measured live) that file's content is not reliably preserved for both
 * writers. This loop's whole reason to exist is checking EARLIER than the ordinary poll, which
 * makes the collision window, not just the fix's own target window, more likely to be hit here —
 * so every attempt re-resolves EVERY live process-log-capable process this machine can see
 * (`scanProcesses`, not only this row) and refuses rather than trusts a shared log, exactly as the
 * poll loop now does.
