/**
 * team-uploader.ts — local → central push for Team Member mode, PER CONNECTION.
 *
 * A machine can be a member of several centrals at once (`preferences.team.connections[]`).
 * Every piece of mutable state that used to be a module-level singleton (error streaks, last
 * success, learned interval, the `running` guard, the debounce timer, the sent-state and
 * sync-signature files) is now keyed by connection id, so one central's failure, cadence or
 * revoked token can never affect another.
 *
 * Pure functions (sessionHash, selectDeltas) are unit-tested.
 * IO functions (loadSentState, saveSentState, pushOnceDetailed, startUploader) are
 * integration-tested manually. handleTeamTestConnection exposes the
 * test-connection route handler.
 *
 * Secrets: the bearer token is NEVER logged.

 *

 *

 *
 * - **The seal ledger (`sealed`/`pending`/`boundary`) is written on EVERY cycle**, unconditionally
 *   and best-effort, exactly as it always was. It is NOT re-derivable: `advanceSeal` seals out of
 *   `prev.pending` — the PERSISTED value, not the freshly measured one — and its CALLER CONTRACT
 *   (share-rules.ts) is that it must run on every push cycle without skipping one, because a day
 *   only seals while it is still in `prev.pending` and the boundary has just passed it. Computing
 *   the ledger in memory and discarding it IS a skipped cycle from the ledger's point of view, and
 *   the case where that happens is the COMMON one: a central that is down, rejecting, or too old
 *   to forget keeps the removal failing for hours. The day would enter `pending` only in memory,
 *   the boundary would cross it, and once its sessions age out of the store the seal is
 *   unrecoverable — the blocked repository's volume for that day then ships inside the
 *   undecomposable rollup.
 * - **The rules hash (and the `sharedIds` snapshot paired with it) is written only once the
 *   removal it implies has actually happened** — `runConnectionPushCycle` does that. The hash is
 *   what suppresses re-detection, so persisting it after a failed removal would make the machine
 *   stop asking with the data still on the central. Unlike the ledger, it IS re-derivable: the
 *   next cycle recomputes the same hash from the same denylist.

 * Member-side proxy for POST /api/team/leave-central, KEPT for an old cached SPA that still
 * PUTs a full flat `team: solo` object after calling this (the current frontend removes a
 * connection through DELETE /api/team/connections/:id instead — see team-connections.ts). The
 * request body (`{ endpoint, token, ... }`, unchanged since the single-connection era) carries no
 * connection id, so it is mapped to one here by matching endpoint or token. Calls the central's
 * /api/team/leave with the given token so the central removes this member's data, then removes
 * ONLY the matching connection (and its state files) via `removeConnection` — never a global
 * reset, which with N connections would hand an UNRELATED central a spurious full re-push. Keeps
 * the token server-side; never throws.
 */
/**
 * Map the legacy `{ endpoint, token }` leave body onto ONE stored connection. Pure.
 *
 * The endpoint half goes through `normalizeEndpointKey` — the shared identity rule every other
 * comparison on this branch already uses — never a raw string compare. This route exists purely for
 * a CACHED SPA, and a cached tab posting `https://Central.example.com` against a stored
 * `https://central.example.com` matched nothing; the token half could not save it either, because
 * `redactPreferences` blanks `team.token` on the way out, so such a tab has no token to send. The
 * route then answered success while removing nothing locally, leaving the connection happily
 * pushing to a central that had just deleted its data.
