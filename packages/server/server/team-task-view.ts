/**
 * team-task-view.ts — PURE. The central's delivery board: what each machine shared, resolved.
 *
 * The wire carries FACTS and no numbers (see `SharedTask`), so the totals are computed HERE — by
 * the very `rollupAttempt` the machine's own board goes through, over the sessions the central
 * already holds. That is what stops a delivery costing one figure on the laptop and another on the
 * central: there is one implementation, not two.
 *
 * Grouped BY MACHINE, because a board belongs to the person whose machine it runs on and the
 * central is many people. **A machine that shares nothing is present and EMPTY** — "this machine
 * has no deliveries" and "this machine shares none of them" are different facts, and a machine
 * that simply vanished from the list would read as the first while being the second.
 *
 * Every rollup here is short by construction whenever the connection withholds sessions, which is
 * why `sessionsWithheld` travels and is carried through to the row: a figure that shrank with
 * nothing on screen explaining why is the same defect as a confident zero.
