/**
 * macos-processes.ts — PURE parsers for macOS's process sources.
 *
 * macOS has no `/proc`: `live-sessions.ts`'s Linux reader has nothing to fall back to, so this
 * reads the same facts (pid, comm, argv, cwd, start time, open files) from the two tools every
 * macOS ships with — `ps` and `lsof` — through the IO layer in `macos-processes-io.ts`.
 *
 * STATED LIMIT, matching this repo's own rule for an unverified reading: every parser below is
 * written against the DOCUMENTED output shapes of `ps -o etime,command` and `lsof -F` (both
 * stable, long-standing BSD/macOS interfaces), not against a capture from a running Mac — this
 * environment has no macOS machine to drive one on. Unlike every other "measured on <date>"
 * comment in this codebase, this one cannot make that claim. Treat it as a first cut that wants
 * verification against a real Mac before being trusted the way the Linux reader is.
 *
 * Two consequences of that limit, both leaning toward under-reporting rather than a wrong answer:
 *   - `ps`'s `command=` field joins argv with plain spaces and carries no quoting, so an argument
 *     that itself contains a space (a path, a prompt) cannot be told apart from two arguments.
 *     Splitting on whitespace is the same imperfect approach the Linux reader already applies to
 *     a pty host's rewritten `argv[0]` (see `isHarnessInfrastructure`'s header) — not a new risk,
 *     but a real one, and worth remembering if a macOS session's argv-derived id ever looks wrong.
 *   - `ps -o comm=` is assumed to print the full executable PATH on macOS, the way it does for a
 *     non-app process there — unlike Linux, where `comm` is the kernel's 15-character-truncated
 *     process name (see `harnessOf`'s header) and the reader turns to `/proc/<pid>/exe` instead.
 *     If that assumption is wrong for some processes, `comm` alone still carries the identical
 *     information `harnessOf` already uses for its exact matches (`PROCESS_HARNESS`), so the
 *     worst case is losing the version-install and script-runtime fallbacks, not the direct one.
