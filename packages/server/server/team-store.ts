/**
 * A team session as stored in Mongo: the SessionMeta plus identity fields and a stable _id.
 *
 * `memberId` is the SHA-256 hash of the member's ingest token (the token doc's `_id`).
 * Keying by `memberId` (not `user`) makes the document stable across member renames:
 * changing the display name never creates a duplicate session in the collection.
 *
 * TIMESTAMPS: `SessionMeta` carries ISO strings because that is the WIRE shape (JSON has no
 * date type and the frontend parses strings). In Mongo they are BSON `Date`s — the three fields
 * below are deliberately re-typed, and `toTeamDoc`/`fromTeamDoc` are the only places that
 * convert. `start_time` is nullable here on purpose: an adapter that could not read a start time
 * reports `''`, and `''` is not a date — storing it as one is the bug this replaced.
 *
 * MIGRATION NOTE: The `_id` scheme changed from `org:user:harness:sessionId` (name-based)
 * to `org:memberId:harness:sessionId` (token-hash-based). Operators must clear stale data
 * once after upgrading: `db.sessions.deleteMany({})`. Legacy sessions are re-ingested on the
 * next uploader push.
