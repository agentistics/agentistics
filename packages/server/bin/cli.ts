const HELP = `
Usage: agentop [command] [options]

Bare \`agentop\` on a terminal opens the control center (services, setup, logs, help).
Without a terminal it prints this help. \`--help\` always prints it.

Commands:
  start         Same control center as bare agentop (non-interactive: runs like 'server')
  setup         Interactive first-run wizard (solo / central / member)
  server        Start the web dashboard + background daemon (non-interactive)
                (add --central to run the team central natively, no Docker; --bg to detach)
  restart       Restart a running mode's service so it picks up new code/config
  status        Show services (server/central/member) + health
  tui           Alias for 'start' — the metrics dashboard is its 'dashboard' tab
  watch         Start the background metrics daemon only
  central       Manage the team central (Docker; runs from anywhere)
  member        Configure this machine as a team member
  session       Start / list / attach assistant sessions (tmux-backed; --bg detaches);
                'session ls' prints the cockpit's table of what is running
  task          BETA — the delivery board: what each piece of work cost, in how many rounds
                and across how many sessions ('task ls | show | deliver | abandon')
  hooks         Teach Claude Code to run work in parallel through agentop
                (installs a skill + SessionStart/Stop hooks; explicit, reversible)
  events        Be told when a session starts waiting, blocks on a permission prompt or
                exits — in an inbox, in another Claude session, and on your desktop
                ('events watch' to subscribe, 'events status' to see who is watching)
  journal       Read-only look at the durable event journal ('journal status')
  ci-push       One-shot push of a CI runner's metrics to a central
  upgrade       Upgrade agentop to the latest version
  autostart     Start a mode with the system (systemd user service on Linux)
  check-update  Print a notice if a newer version is available (else silent);
                a release marked [critical] says so louder (auto-install is opt-in)
  doctor        Run the exposure preflight; add --exposed to check against the
                strict public bar before opening a tunnel
  setup-token   Reissue the one-time OWNER setup token (central only; run it where the
                central runs: ./central.sh setup-token, or agentop central setup-token)
  reset-password
                Reset an account's password from the host (central only) — the recovery
                path when the last owner is locked out. --email <address>, optional
                --password <new> and --clear-mfa

Options:
  --help, -h       Show this help message
  --version, -v    Show current version
  --port <n>       Port for the web server (default: 47291)  [server, start]
  --central        Run as the team central natively (no Docker) — reads central.env for
                   MONGO_URL + secrets; requires an external MONGO_URL (Atlas/mongod)  [server only]
  --bg             Start detached in the background (logs to ~/.agentistics)  [server only]

Native central (no Docker):
  agentop server --central [--bg] [--port <n>]
    Runs the same server process with AGENTISTICS_TEAM_CENTRAL=1, loading central.env
    (search: $AGENTISTICS_CENTRAL_ENV, ./central.env, ~/.agentistics/central.env). There is no
    bundled Mongo — set MONGO_URL to an external cluster. Use --bg to run in the background like
    the local server. For the all-in-one Docker flow (bundled Mongo) use \`agentop central up\`.

Control center:
  agentop            (on a terminal)
  agentop start
    One full-screen application, in the terminal's alternate buffer — it adds nothing to
    your scrollback. Tabs: Services (start/stop/restart this machine, a central or the
    Docker machine; connect to or leave a central; enable a boot service), Setup (solo /
    central / member and the history-preservation consent), Logs, Cheat sheet, Help,
    Contribute. Picking "foreground" closes it and starts the server in this terminal.
    Non-interactive stdin runs like 'agentop server'.

Restart:
  agentop restart [server|watch|central|--all] [--rebuild] [-y|-n] [--cache]
    Restart a running mode so it picks up new code (after an upgrade/pull) or config.
    server/watch bounce the systemd user service; central restarts its container.
    --all bounces every service currently up (local + central + machine), non-interactively.
    --rebuild recreates the Docker image/container (central + machine) instead of just bouncing
    it — use it to pick up new code in Docker deployments (native server: use bun bin / upgrade).
    A --rebuild builds the image from SCRATCH (no Docker cache), so it cannot hand you back the
    image it just replaced. That is slow — several minutes — so:
      --cache      reuse Docker's layer cache instead (the fast path)
      -y / --yes   re-run the central's interactive setup, without being asked
      -n / --no    do not re-run it, without being asked (a rebuild's default when it has no
                   terminal to ask on). Passing both -y and -n is refused.

Setup:
  agentop setup
    Interactive wizard: pick solo, host a central, or join one as a member.
    The control center's Setup tab asks the same questions.

Central:
  agentop central <up|init|down|logs|status|restart|pull|setup-token|reset-password>
    HOW it runs is your choice, and \`up\` takes it as a flag:
      --image    Docker, published image (ghcr.io/blpsoares/agentistics) — no checkout needed
      --build    Docker, built from this checkout (central.sh)
      --native   the agentop binary IS the server — no Docker; needs an external MONGO_URL
      --bg       native only: detach instead of holding this terminal
    Unstated, it uses whatever \`agentop central init\` recorded, and failing that the same
    default as before (a checkout builds; otherwise the database decides). A shape that cannot
    work here is refused in a sentence, never silently swapped for another.
    \`up\` also accepts -y/--yes or -n/--no (answer "re-run interactive setup?" up front, for
    unattended runs; both together is refused) and --no-cache/--cache (build the image from
    scratch, or reuse Docker's layer cache — cached by default on a plain \`up\`).
    \`init\` asks for the port, org, bind interface, database and the shape above, and writes
    central.env (chmod 600). Publishing it on the internet is a separate step and a separate
    set of variables — see docs/exposure.md.
    setup-token reissues the one-time OWNER setup token (for when the boot that printed it
    scrolled away), running where the database is reachable. Refused once an owner exists.
    reset-password --email <address> resets an account's password from the host — there is no
    e-mail-based reset, so this is how a locked-out last owner gets back in.

Member (a machine may belong to several centrals at once):
  agentop member connect --token <token> [--endpoint <url>] [--org <org>] [--label <name>]
    Verify the token against the central, then add a new connection or UPDATE an existing
    one keyed by its endpoint (a token rotation on a known central updates in place).
    A token minted by a central with a public URL configured carries that URL, so the token
    alone is enough — --endpoint is only needed for a bare token.
  agentop member list
    List every connection this machine has, with its live sync state. ('status' is an alias.)
  agentop member status [--endpoint <url>]
    Show every connection's mode/endpoint/user/last-sync (or just one, with --endpoint).
  agentop member leave [--endpoint <url>] [--all]
    0 connections     nothing to do.
    1 connection      leaves it, no prompt.
    N, --endpoint     leaves that one connection.
    N, --all          leaves every connection — back to solo.
    N, no flag, TTY   arrow-key picker (pick one, "Leave all", or Cancel).
    N, no flag, non-TTY  refuses — pass --endpoint <url> or --all instead of guessing.

CI (GitHub Actions):
  agentop ci-push [--endpoint <url>] [--token <ci-token>] [--org <org>]
    One-shot push of this runner's metrics to a central. Prefers keyless
    GitHub OIDC (needs permissions: id-token: write); falls back to a
    static token. Reads AGENTISTICS_CENTRAL_URL / AGENTISTICS_CI_TOKEN /
    AGENTISTICS_OIDC_AUDIENCE / AGENTISTICS_TEAM_ORG when flags are omitted.
    Never fails the job on a push error.

Claude Code integration:
  agentop hooks <install|uninstall|status> [--hook-only|--skill-only]
    Two things, both explicit and both reversible:
      skill  ~/.claude/skills/agentop-parallel-sessions/SKILL.md — WHAT Claude needs to know
             to split independent work across several assistants and start them with
             \`agentop session batch\`. Loaded by Claude only when the task matches it, so it
             costs nothing on a session that never parallelises.
      hook   a SessionStart entry in ~/.claude/settings.json — FACTS a static file cannot
             hold: which agentop sessions are running now, which one is blocked on a
             permission prompt, which task can be reopened here. Prints nothing when there
             is nothing running.
    A hook infers nothing; it is a shell command on an event. The inference is Claude's,
    reading what the skill teaches and what the hook injected. \`uninstall\` removes exactly
    what \`install\` wrote, and every other key in settings.json is left untouched.

Updates:
  agentop upgrade
    Download the latest binary and restart whatever services are running. Only installs a
    release published for this platform/arch, verifies the download (size, executable magic
    and the new binary's own --version) before swapping it in, keeps the previous binary at
    <binary>.bak and restores it if anything fails. Exits non-zero when the install was
    refused/rolled back or a service could not be restarted onto the new version.
  agentop check-update
    Silent when up to date. Answers from ~/.agentistics/version-cache.json and refreshes it
    in a detached process, so it never delays a shell prompt. An OPTIONAL update prints a
    banner; a CRITICAL update (its GitHub release notes contain a "[critical]" line outside
    code fences) prints a louder one telling you to run \`agentop upgrade\`. Unattended install
    is OPT-IN: set AGENTISTICS_AUTO_UPGRADE=1 to let a critical release install itself in a
    detached background process, logged to ~/.agentistics/auto-upgrade.log.

Autostart:
  agentop autostart <mode> <enable|disable|status>
    mode ∈ { server, central, watch, machine }
    enable   Register + start the service at boot (also adds a terminal
             update-check hook to ~/.bashrc)
    disable  Stop and remove the service
    status   Show enabled/active state (omit mode to list all)
    Manager: systemd user units on Linux, launchd user agents on macOS, or pm2 anywhere it is
    installed (never chosen by default — it is your process list). None of them needs root, and
    each names the one step it cannot take for you so a reboot really does bring the service
    back: linger on systemd, login-not-boot on launchd, \`pm2 save\` + \`pm2 startup\` on pm2.
    \`central\` follows the shape that central was configured with, so a natively started
    central gets a unit that starts it natively rather than one that starts Docker.

Examples:
  agentop start
  agentop setup
  agentop central up --image        # a central from the published image, no clone
  agentop central up --native --bg  # a central on Atlas, detached, no Docker
  agentop server
  agentop server --port 4000
  agentop restart server
  agentop watch
  agentop central up
  agentop member connect --token act1_aHR0cHM6Ly9jZW50cmFsLmV4YW1wbGU.abc123
  agentop member connect --endpoint http://host:48080 --token abc123
  agentop member connect --endpoint http://other:48080 --token def456 --label "Client B"
  agentop member list
  agentop member leave --endpoint http://host:48080
  agentop member leave --all
  agentop upgrade
  agentop check-update
  agentop autostart server enable
  agentop autostart status
  agentop hooks install
  agentop hooks status
