 * `MODEL_PRICING`, with each row's 1-hour-TTL cache-write rate (`cacheWrite1h`) added.

 * Anthropic's prompt-caching pricing: cache writes cost **1.25x base input for a 5-minute TTL,
 * 2x base input for a 1-hour TTL** (platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing → Prompt
 * caching; cross-checked against the `claude-api` skill's bundled `shared/prompt-caching.md` §
 * Economics, verified 2026-09-17). `BASE_MODEL_PRICING.cacheWrite` above already encodes the
 * 1.25x rate, so `cacheWrite1h` is `input * 2` here — derived in ONE place rather than hand-typed
 * per row, which is what let a stale product-wide assumption (every cache write billed at 1.25x)
 * go unnoticed: `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens` was 78,3 % of measured cache-write volume on this
 * machine and none of it was priced at its real rate. See `packages/server/server/jsonl.ts` for
 * where the two portions are read off the transcript, and `calcCost` for how each is priced.
 *
 * Gemini and OpenAI rows have no 1-hour cache tier and never populate the breakdown fields that
 * would select this rate (see the "unused in practice" notes above), so `cacheWrite1h` on those
 * rows is inert — deriving it uniformly is simpler than special-casing providers that never read
 * it, and it costs nothing to be wrong-but-unused there.
