/**
 * stagedSession.ts — a DORMANT session draft held on one subtask (or group) of a delivery.
 *
 * Board task t-918cc82233. Distinct from `sessionPresets.ts` in exactly the way that module's own
 * header states: a `SessionPreset` is machine-wide and task-agnostic (a personal "quick launch"
 * shelf with no board connection at all); a `StagedSessionDraft` is the opposite — it lives ON one
 * specific subtask or group of one specific delivery, and firing it FILES the resulting session
 * under that exact subtask/group automatically, with no manual filing step afterward. The two share
 * a shape (prompt + optional harness/model/effort/cwd) because they answer the same underlying
 * question — "what does a new session need to start" — but they are stored, validated and launched
 * through entirely separate paths; a preset never becomes a staged draft or vice versa.
 *
 * WHY THE FIELDS ARE ALL OPTIONAL EXCEPT `prompt`: unlike `SessionPreset` (whose `harness` is
 * required — it launches from a machine-wide shelf with no other context to fall back on), a staged
 * draft is composed IN PLACE on a subtask, ahead of time, possibly before the person has decided
 * which assistant or folder fits. `prompt` alone is required — a draft with nothing to say is not a
 * draft, the same reasoning `sessionPresets.ts` applies to `promptTemplate`. Firing a draft missing
 * `harness` or `cwd` falls back to the ordinary new-session wizard, pre-filled with whatever the
 * draft DOES have (see `NewSessionModal`'s `initialPreset`/`initialSubtaskId`) — the wizard's own
 * review step is that draft's consent gate, exactly as it is for a cwd-less `SessionPreset`.
 *
 * ATTACHMENTS are `TaskFile` ids, never a second file store: a pasted screenshot or an uploaded spec
 * becomes a real task file (the same mechanism a comment's pasted image uses — see
 * `web/src/lib/commentBody.ts`), and the draft holds only a REFERENCE to it. At fire time the
 * referenced files are materialized into the new session's own local attachment paths (the same
 * `/api/fleet/attach` store the ordinary composer uses) and prepended to the prompt — see
 * `composePromptWithPaths`, which mirrors `NewSessionModal`'s own `promptWithAttachments` exactly.
 *
 * A GROUP MEMBER can never hold this — see `task-attach.ts`'s `subtask_in_group` refusal, which this
 * module's callers must reuse rather than reimplement (a member can never receive a session of its
 * own, so a draft that could never be fired there is refused at the same point).
