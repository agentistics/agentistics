/**
 * echoMatch.ts — PURE: which delivered messages the transcript has taken in.
 *
 * An echo is a message already handed to the session, shown in the conversation until the
 * transcript carries it. Retiring it was an EQUALITY test over collapsed whitespace, and equality
 * is the wrong relation — measured on the transcript of the session that reported this:
 *
 *     '> /home/…/9f6434bc-image.png\n> era mais ou menos algo assim…\n'
 *     'pode fazer tudo. so quanto aquela imagem vc n me respondeu\r\n'
 *     '\n[Image #22] esse prompt ta pendurado tem uma eternidade…'
 *
 * ONE user entry, holding TWO messages. A harness that is mid-turn QUEUES what arrives and commits
 * the queue as a single turn, so the second message is stored joined to the first — and the
 * terminal put `\r` in it on the way. The echo is therefore a SUBSTRING of what was stored and can
 * never equal it, so the label stood there forever under a message that had arrived and been
 * answered. "ainda tem mensagem que ta ficando eternamente na fila."
 *
 * So containment, not equality — with one guard. A very short echo ("ok", "sim") appears inside
 * unrelated turns by coincidence, and retiring it there would hide a message that really was still
 * waiting. Below `SAFE_CONTAINS_LEN` the old equality rule stands: a false "still waiting" on a
 * two-letter message costs a glance, a false "delivered" costs the message.
 *
 * THE SECOND SHAPE, AND IT LOOKED LIKE A DUPLICATE MESSAGE. A message with attachments is sent as
 * one path per line followed by the prose — that is what the composer types into the pane — and the
 * harness stores it with the paths REPLACED by its own markers. Measured on this machine:
 *
 *   echo    '/home/u/.agentistics/attachments/ab-image.png\n…/cd-image.png\nvou te passar…'
 *   stored  '[Image #26] [Image #27]vou te passar…'
 *
 * Neither equal nor contained, so the echo stood forever BESIDE the transcript's own copy of the
 * same message — two bubbles, one message. Reported as exactly that: "aparentemente o prompt que eu
 * mandei por aqui tbm foi enviado via terminal e dai duplicou". Nothing was sent twice.
 *
 * So an echo is also compared by its PROSE — itself minus the attachment lines it added. And when
 * there is no prose (a message that was only files), by the COUNT: a stored turn that is nothing
 * but markers, as many as the echo carried paths. That second rule is narrow on purpose — it never
 * fires on a turn that has words in it.
 *
 * THE THIRD SHAPE — A SHORT MESSAGE WITH NO WAY OUT, and this one had no expiry at all. Every rule
 * above is a comparison, so a message the comparisons cannot recognise waits FOREVER. Under
 * `SAFE_CONTAINS_LEN` only equality is allowed — deliberately, a two-letter echo appears inside
 * unrelated turns by coincidence — and the queue-joining shape above is exactly what makes equality
 * fail. Reported with a three-letter message: "executei o btw no claude e n apareceu nada na
 * sessão, na real tá enfileirado eternamente." It had been read and answered.
 *
 * The way out is not a timeout — a session really can sit on its queue for an hour, and a timer
 * that retires an unread message is the one error worse than this one. It is ORDER. Delivery is
 * FIFO: the write channel is FIFO by construction, `editEcho` APPENDS, and a harness commits its
 * input queue in the order it arrived. So a LATER echo appearing in the transcript is proof that
 * every earlier one was read — it could not have been overtaken. `landedIndex` is that rule, and it
 * costs nothing in confidence: the later echo was recognised by the very comparisons above, and the
 * earlier ones are then a deduction from ordering rather than a guess about their text.
