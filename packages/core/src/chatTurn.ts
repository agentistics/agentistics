/**
 * chatTurn.ts — what ONE turn of a conversation is, whatever harness wrote it.
 *
 * It lived inside `chat-tail.ts`, the CLAUDE transcript reader, for as long as Claude was the only
 * harness whose conversation could be read at all, then in `server/sessions/chat-turn.ts` once every
 * reader in `harness-transcript.ts` produced it. It is in core now (engine-api 1.9, `HarnessChat`)
 * because the ENGINE's chat channel produces it too: the host and the engine must agree on one shape,
 * and a second harness — or a second package — importing the first one's module to learn what a turn
 * is would make that module the thing the others are defined against rather than one of them.
 *
 * Nothing here is Claude-specific. Where a field only ever applies to one harness that is said on
 * the field, not enforced by which module owns it. `@agentistics/engine-api` re-declares it
 * structurally (`EngineChatTurn`); `engine-api-mirrors.test.ts` keeps the two EQUAL.
