/**
 * sharedTask.ts — what a delivery looks like ON THE WIRE, and nothing more.
 *
 * The board is a local store. A task travels to a central only when its owner says so
 * (`Task.shared`, absent reading as NOT shared), and what travels is this shape — a LIST, exactly
 * like `redactSessionText`'s list of free-text fields, and for the same reason: a field added to
 * the server's `Task` does not reach a central until somebody adds it HERE and decides that it
 * should. A wire type derived automatically from the record would ship every future field by
 * default, which is the opposite of an opt-in.
 *
 * Three deliberate absences:
 *
 *  - **No numbers.** No cost, no rounds, no token totals. The central already holds the sessions
 *    this machine shares with it, so it resolves the rollup through the very `task-rollup.ts` the
 *    local board uses. A total computed on the member and shipped would be a second answer to
 *    "what did this delivery cost", and the two would drift.
 *  - **No claim.** A lease lasts 30 minutes and the push cadence is seconds to minutes, so a claim
 *    arrives already stale and reads as "somebody is on this right now" long after they stopped.
 *    Who is working on what is a question for the machine that can see its own fleet.
 *  - **No file bytes.** The central learns that N files exist and what they are called; fetching
 *    one is an on-demand pull over the reverse channel, the way raw chat already works.
