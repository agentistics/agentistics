/**
 * The reading defect that shipped v1.23.1 as a patch, kept from coming back.
 *
 * `git log --pretty=format:` omits the terminal newline on the LAST record, and a
 * `while IFS= read -r` loop silently drops a final line without one — so the OLDEST commit in
 * every range went unclassified. A range whose only `feat` was that commit fell through to the
 * bash `patch` default and a feature was published as a correction. Reproduced on this repo's
 * own history: `fd283a1d..548aa5c8` holds exactly one commit, `feat(vscode): …`, and the old
 * reader classified ZERO of it.
 *
 * `versionBump.test.ts` pins the arithmetic. It cannot see the SHELL, and the shell is where the
 * defect lived: the calculation was never wrong, the commits simply never reached it. Nothing in
 * YAML objects to `format:` — it is one character from the correct form, it is what every
 * StackOverflow answer prints, and it fails only on the oldest record of a range, which is the
 * one case a hand test rarely covers. So the guard is a grep over the workflows themselves, the
 * same shape `tokens.lint.test.ts` uses over the product source.
 *
 * Two things are asserted:
 *
 *  1. **no workflow or shell script reads with `--pretty=format:` / `--format=format:`.**
 *     `tformat:` terminates every record and is correct everywhere `format:` is — including
 *     inside `$(…)`, which strips trailing newlines and so hides the difference until somebody
 *     copies the line into a loop. Banning the form outright is what makes the rule teachable;
 *     a rule that says "only in a loop" has to be re-argued at every call site.
 *  2. **the release workflow DELEGATES the bump to `@agentistics/core`** and carries no bash
 *     default of its own. The silent `patch` floor is the other half of the defect: a read that
 *     returned nothing became a patch release instead of a failed job. `bumpFromCommits` throws
 *     on an empty list precisely so that cannot happen, and that guarantee is worth nothing if
 *     the workflow ever goes back to deciding the bump itself.
 *
 * Escape hatch for (1): `@git-format-intentional` with a reason on the same or the preceding
 * line — which turns a silent mistake into a decision somebody wrote down.
