/**
 * sessionPresets.ts — reusable "quick launch" session templates ("preset/wake").
 *
 * A preset is a saved combination of what a new session needs to start: which harness to run, the
 * literal first message, and optionally where to run it and which model/effort to ask for. It is
 * per-MACHINE preference (`Preferences.sessionPresets` in `packages/server/server/preferences.ts`),
 * never board data — "a template I like to reuse" is a fact about how one person works, not about
 * the work itself, and it never leaves the machine (same reasoning as `billing`/`comparisons`).
 *
 * WHY `promptTemplate` HAS NO TEMPLATING SYNTAX: it is the literal text typed into the session's
 * first message, unchanged — exactly the convention `fleet-spawn.ts`'s own `prompt` field already
 * uses (see `NewSessionModal`'s `promptWithAttachments`, which is composed by the CALLER before the
 * string ever reaches `/api/fleet/new`). Nothing in this product interpolates a first prompt, so a
 * `{{var}}` syntax here would be a second, unused convention for the same idea.
 *
 * TWO STRUCTURAL RULES CARRIED OVER FROM THE BOARD SPEC (t-918cc82233, s-d85c7d9d9d):
 * - A preset is NEVER a session. It holds no state, no tmux registration, nothing capturable — the
 *   same argument `shell-isolation.test.ts` exists to have settled once already. It must never be
 *   drawn as if it were a session row, and it can never enter the fleet registry.
 * - Launching one starts a REAL billable assistant. The caller (the web launch shelf) must gate the
 *   act with its own consent step — a click on a shelf of 44px cards is not, on its own, the
 *   deliberate act starting an assistant should require.
